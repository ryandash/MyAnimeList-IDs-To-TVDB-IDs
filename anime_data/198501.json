    "SummaryEnglish": "Over 2000 years ago the ancient god of destruction Ongo was sealed away. Now two thousand years later, he will be freed due to the hapless actions of a Japanese archaeologist. Fortunately for the world, the archaeologist has also given his daughter Natsumi a necklace that will allow her to call upon the powers of the ancient flowers spirits to help protect Tokyo from Ongo. Though that doesn't seem like it may even be necessary as the \"God of Destruction\" seems to only be two feet tall and more annoying than dangerous.",

Unknown to Natsumi is that the statue is the seal for the God of Destruction and Chaos, Ongo. She releases Ongo when she puts on the jewel earrings of the statue. Instead of being a horrible monster, Ongo turns out to be a super-deformed jungle boy. Natsumi then has a dream where Aham, God of Earth, appears before her. He's a perverted old shaman that has a large horn covering his private parts. Aham gives Natsumi the skull necklace that allows her to transform into the extremely busty Flower Goddess Mii. To transform, Natsumi must do an erotic and perverted dance.",
