As a 35-year-old salaryman, he has limited time and money to spend on food, which shapes his choice of lunchtime. Throughout the manga, Hiroshi describes the food, delivers food trivia, and gripes about workplace woes, such as having to treat his seniors to food, sudden workloads shortening his lunch break, and hated bosses.",
