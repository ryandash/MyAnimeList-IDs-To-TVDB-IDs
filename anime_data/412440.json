    "SummaryEnglish": "Berserk Redux is a fan project blending the various animated Berserk adaptations into a more faithful and cinematic version that tells the full story of the manga in movie form. Berserk has been adapted into two anime series, a trilogy of movies, and has several game adaptations. All of them leave major gaps in story and character development, but luckily each fills complementary holes in others.",

    "SummaryJapanese": "Berserk Reduxは、さまざまなアニメーションのBerserkの適応を、漫画の全貌を映画の形で伝える、より忠実で映画的なバージョンにブレンドしたファンプロジェクトです。 ベルセルクは2つのアニメシリーズ、映画の三部作に適応されており、いくつかのゲームの適応があります。 それらはすべて、ストーリーとキャラクターの開発に大きなギャップを残しますが、幸いなことに、それぞれが他の人の補完的な穴を埋めます。",
