  "SummaryEnglish": "Berserk Redux is a fan project blending the various animated Berserk adaptations into a more faithful and cinematic version that tells the full story of the manga in movie form. Berserk has been adapted into two anime series, a trilogy of movies, and has several game adaptations. All of them leave major gaps in story and character development, but luckily each fills complementary holes in others.",
