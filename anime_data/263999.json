When the old man wakes, he sees Winter is visited by another sister named Spring, who begins planting seeds and watering a garden for the old man. Later on, they are joined by the third sister, Summer, who convinces the old man to step outside his door and embrace the world around him. As they prepare for dinner, the fourth and eldest sister, Fall, arrives to join them. The old man then asks the sisters why they decided to help him, and Fall replies it is because they are able to. In return for their kindness, the wizard musters all of the power he can, and offers it to the four sisters, granting them unique abilities. The Four Maidens are grateful to the old man and set off to share their gifts with the world, promising him that they will visit him again on a yearly basis."
