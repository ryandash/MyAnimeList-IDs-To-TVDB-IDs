    "SummaryEnglish": "Murasame Sumika is popular in the high school for her excellence in the marks and sports. However, she has a secret: she is in love with her classmate Kazama Ushio, but she hasn't noticed Sumika's feelings. On the other hand Ushio also has a liking to the love between girls but she only shows any interest in cutesy girls. Sumika, a card-carrying badass who helps run her family's dojo, does not fit this bill even a little. Cue angst, as she is forced to watch from the sidelines as Ushio falls for girl after girl, none of them her. Ushio is always eager to share news about her latest crush. With the duo's knack for attracting trouble, it looks like Sumika's trials have only just begun.",
