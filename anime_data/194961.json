As Kyosuke gets in line, he runs into his classmate, Kōhei Akagi, who is buying a yaoi eroge for his own sister. Meanwhile, Kuroneko calls Kirino about the cat ears she is making for her and also tells Kirino that she might be going to change \"her way of calling\" Kyosuke. Kyousuke, after realizing that the trains are no longer running, manages to convince one of the other customers to lend him his bike so he can ride back home. After Kyosuke gets back home with the game, Kirino asks him to play with her. She then shows him all of the medals and report cards with bad grades she had received throughout the years. The next morning, Kyosuke learns that Kirino has left home for America for track and field training, leaving him to wonder about the night before and why she never told him about her departure. In the beginning of the new school term, Kyosuke meets up with Kuroneko, who would be attending his school as his underclassman.",

Blaming Manami for the sudden change in him, Kirino confronted her, asking her to give back the brother she loved so much, just to hear from her that the Kyosuke she envisioned never existed in the first place. To get back at Kyosuke, Kirino focused to improve herself and started avoiding him. Years later, she starts working as a model and befriends Ayase, but also develops her otaku hobbies, and becomes too ashamed to share them with anyone else. The issues she had with her secret were what somehow reapproached her with Kyosuke, who since then always stood by Kirino's side to support and protect her, even though she no longer sees him as the brother she once idolized.",
