  "SummaryEnglish": "On his first day at the publishing company, Shota Tendou fell in love with Yui Yamanobe, who became his mentor. She is a stunning beauty with a bust over 90 centimeters, a slim waist, and long legs, almost like a goddess. Beyond her looks, Yui is also a competent editor, responsible for several popular works in just her fifth year at the company. She interacts with Shota in a friendly manner, not flaunting her status as an admired boss. As they work together, their bond grows closer, but Shota struggles to find the courage to confess his feelings, especially since Yui, with her lack of romantic experience, is also dealing with insecurities. Amid their daily interactions, Shota and Yui end up going on a business trip together for a gravure photoshoot.",
