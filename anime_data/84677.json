Felli soon spots Nina and the rest of her 17th platoon at the pool too, and Kallian makes a suggestion to have Nina teach Felli how to swim, although Felli is reluctant. Meanwhile Naruki and Mifi talk to Layfon and gets him to teach Mayshen how to swim. Seeing this, Felli becomes jealous and decides to learn how to swim. After swimming Felli becomes suspicious on why the whole 17th platoon decided to spend their free time at the pool and questions Nina about it. Stuttering and obviously nervous, Nina quickly makes up a lie to tell to Felli and Felli believes it. After that Felli sees everyone talking to her brother Kallian about a deal of some sort. The next day at the pool, Nina tries to get Felli to swim but Felli refuses. Sharnid comes up with the idea to get Layfon to teach Felli. Felli accepts and her face starts to turn red and her brother Kallian notices this (Kallian actually notices quite a few times in this episode). After swimming Kallian locks up Layfon in a room and has a talk with him and hints about him and Felli being in a relationship (although Layfon is obviously confused)and Layfon will feel his wrath if he so dares to hurt Felli. A couple scenes later, Felli and Nina are taken as hostages in the inn they were staying by terrorists. Felli tries to look for their dites but starts to become noticeable with the pink glow she gives off as she is searching. Felli and Nina retrieve their dites and take down the terrorists along with the help of Sharnid. Felli soon realizes that Nina wanted to teach her how to swim so that she would become tired and not be able to use her psychic powers with such force that she becomes noticeable. Nina and Harley start to apologize and told Felli that they were bribed by her brother Kallian to do this. Felli asks if Layfon knew about this and Sharnid says that Layfon had no idea and if he did he would not lie to Felli about it. Harley notices that Layf",

Back at Gorneo’s room, Haia and Myunfa are introducing themselves to Shante and Gorneo and Gorneo questions their true intentions. Haia actually just actually wants information from Gorneo about the Fallen One. Later, Harley and Layfon are seen replacing Layfon’s broken adamandite sword. Harley says it will be easier for him just to make a new one, and tells Layfon to try out a Katana due to his fighting style. However, Layfon says he can’t use it for reasons we don’t know yet. Nina asks Layfon what’s wrong with him, but then Naruki comes in and asks for Nina’s and Layfon’s help to find out more about the Overload smugglers and users. Layfon tells Felli they won’t be having practices for a while, and thus she leaves and meets Haia, Myunfa, and her brother Kallian at the train station. In the next scene, Layfon, Nina, and Naruki are observing the 10th platoon (Dinn Dee’s platoon) and Naruki tells them that they are the Overload users. After Dinn’s practice with his platoon, he and Siena are seen leaving. Nina confronts Dinn face to face and tells him to stop using the Overload. Dinn says it is impossible due to the fact that he wants to become stronger. Later Nina tells the story of how Sharnid became part of her 17th platoon. Layfon, Nina, and Sharnid all go to Kallian and ask him for information regarding Dinn. Kallian comes up with a plan to disband the 10th platoon, and tells them that Layfon needs to work with Haia to stop Dinn.

In his reminiscence, he remembers how their city lost the intercity match, making their former platoon leader become dejected. After seeing their former platoon leader in such a state, Sharnid, Sheena, and Dinn, all made a vow to defend Zuelli with their own hands. However, Sharnid also informs the 17th platoon that at the time of the vow their friendship was already breaking up, and he left the 10th platoon to try to completely break the three of them up. Thus he wants this chance to completely break them up and then try to reconnect them together again. Moments later the inter-platoon match has started, and Dinn is doing amazingly well as he has already broken through many of the traps set by the 17th platoon, but is feeling side effects from the Overload. Suddenly, the ground in front of the 10th platoon breaks, leaving Siena by herself. Dinn tells her to go on, and she does, meeting Sharnid in a 1v1 fight. Sharnid now shows his new weapons, which are two pistol dites. Siena and Sharnid begin to battle it out, and although Sharnid puts up a good fight, he loses at the end. Thus he begins to interrogate Siena about why Dinn is not letting her help defend Zuelli by using the Overload just as Dinn has been. Layfon has begun to fight with Dinn, and even though Dinn is using Overload, Layfon wins easily. Dinn goes into what seems to be berserker state due to the Fallen One.
