    "TitleEnglish": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood",
    "SummaryEnglish": "Edward and Alphonse Elric's reckless disregard for alchemy's fun­damental laws ripped half of Ed's limbs from his body and left Al's soul clinging to a cold suit of armor. To restore what was lost, the brothers scour a war-torn land for the Philosopher's Sto­ne, a fabled relic which grants the ability to perform alchemy in impossible ways. The Elrics are not alone in their search; the corrupt State Military is also eager to harness the artifact's power. So too are the strange Homunculi and their shadowy creator. The mythical gem lures exotic alchemists from distant kingdoms, scarring some deeply enough to inspire murder. As the Elrics find their course altered by these enemies and allies, their purpose remains unchanged – and their bond unbreakable.",

She reveals this as the result of the real Rosalie's transmutation, whilst she herself is a girl named Amy who was adopted due to her similar appearance. As Ed arrives on the scene, the Madam tells him that her late husband kept the truth about the transmutation's failure from Judau, who truly wanted to resurrect Rosalie.

Roy passes through the Gate of Truth and reappears in Father's lair with Pride, Father, and the other sacrifices, and finds he has lost his eyesight in exchange. Scar battles Bradley above, and May crashes through the ceiling of Father's lair to find Al unconscious. Al stands before the Gate to find his body, but despairs that he will be unable to use it to fight alongside the others because it is so frail. He promises to return for his body and goes through the Gate, regaining consciousness in Father's lair and completing Father's count for the five sacrifices.",

Father neutralizes everyone's alchemy, but, before he can annihilate them, Hohenheim reveals his countermeasure: he had spent years traveling the country, placing fragments of his own Philosopher's Stone into the earth to use as foundation for returning the Amestrian souls to their bodies. The stone fragments are activated by the eclipse's umbra, and the souls are ripped from Father's body back into their original bodies, which weakens Father to the point of barely being able to suppress God anymore. The eclipse then lifts, blinding Bradley with sunlight and allowing Scar to kill him. Scar activates the nationwide alkahestry circle his brother and fellow Ishbalans had been preparing, which restores everyone else's alchemy at their greatest potential. Facing the full strength of his opponents' attacks in his unstable body, Father retreats aboveground to find more souls and replenish his stone supply. Ed remains behind to fight Pride while everyone else chases Father. Pride tries to steal Ed's body to replace his own unstable one, but Kimblee's soul reappears within him and taunts him while Ed enters his body and destroys it, reverting him to the form of a small fetus-like creature. Ed spares Pride's life and leaves to join his friends.",

Before Father can kill Ed and Izumi, the Briggs soldiers, along with several of Ed's allies, join up to attack Father and use up his stone supply.
