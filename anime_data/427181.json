  "SummaryEnglish": "According to legend, the peaceful Pluster World fell into chaos with the appearance of the Minusters, and in response, all of the Plusters fought alongside the humans, or, more specifically, merging with them in order to become more powerful (\"plusting\"), and were able to seal away the evil Minusters. The resulting peace was thought to continue forever, with the world once again returning to fruition, but the peace has been shattered again by the reappearance of the Minusters.",
