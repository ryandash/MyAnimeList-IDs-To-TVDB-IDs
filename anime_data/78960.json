Kai, Lewis, and David are now in London, living at a shelter for war orphans run by Gray, an ex-military man and David's former instructor. Kai now wears the crystal chunk from Riku's body around his neck in the form of a diamond-shaped pendant. Devastated by the events and with his spirit broken, David lives in a drunken stupor. Joel, confined to a wheelchair from the injury Carl gave him, brings Kai some special bullets they hope will be able to kill chiroptera. He also reveals that Julia is in the United States with Collins. Joel thinks David hates him for what happened and he blames himself for Riku death. Kai tells him he is determined to stop Diva and her chevaliers, and that he must do all that he can until Saya returns. Gray lectures David on his walling in self-pity when Kai has turned his loss into his strength and found his purpose. Later, Kai pours out all of David's alcohol, asking him what he would say to those who died. David says it is pointless without Saya, and Kai yells at him it is his job to wait for her. Meanwhile, in the US, James and Van give a demonstration of their new soldiers, the Corpse Corps. Three of the soldiers kill a single chiropteran, and Dr. Collins tells Julia they don't need Saya anymore. The US agrees to use them. As the Corpse Corps are transported, several Schiff watch from the shadows. That night, Kai and Lewis are out hunting chiroptera, but the new bullets do not work. As they find themselves surrounded by three chiroptera, Saya and Hagi appear.",

At the subway station, Saya starts to faint, almost falling in front of the train but Kai catches her. Later, Saya promises Kai that she will always protect him and asks him to take better care of himself. Kai has a key of their father's bar made for Saya, so they can run it together. David leaves the hospital and returns to work. Saya and Hagi remember her making him promise to kill her, with his own hands, when everything is over. As he, Lewis, Julia, Joel, and Okamura discuss the situation, they realize the American government has Cinq Flèches deliberately creating chiroptera in America, and abroad, to create enemies they can then rescue the people from using the Corpse Corp. Julia explains to them that Diva's singing, when heard in person or a live process, it increases the effectiveness of the D-base that causes people to turn to chiroptera from 3% to 100%. Meanwhile, Nathan visits Solomon and takes him to see Diva and the babies, which Amshel \"cut out of her stomach.\" Nathan tells him that now that the babies are born, he has no reason to fight his family anymore. To prove his commitment to Saya, Solomon attempts to kill Diva, but Diva easily defeats him and leaves him badly wounded. As Diva takes the babies inside, Nathan wonders if even a chevalier can survive such wounds.",

Hagi asks Saya to reconsider their promise, but she makes him ask her to fight again. Amshel orders Nathan to kill Solomon, but Nathan releases him from the dungeon instead. James, in his full chiropteran form, goes to the apartment and attacks Saya. When Saya attacks him, though, her sword bounces off his skin.
