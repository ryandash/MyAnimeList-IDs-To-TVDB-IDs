    "SummaryEnglish": "Luo Zhongxia, a modern teenager, accidentally encounters a pen spirit closely related to the \"Seven Lords of Guancheng\", and a wonderful world related to the pen tomb opens the door to him. However, although the young man had an unexpected encounter, he was frequently coveted by various forces because of the crime of possessing the jade. The young man just wanted to avoid disputes and was looking for a way to withdraw from the book. Although the process of withdrawing the pen always backfired, the young man grew up because of it, and gradually grew from a student who only knew how to escape and had no knowledge of learning to a responsible and strategic \"pen tomb official\".",
