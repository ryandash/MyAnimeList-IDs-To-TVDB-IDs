    "SummaryEnglish": "This work is a short drama of 5 episodes directed by Mika Ninagawa. Director Nagikawa, who is famous for his colorful video works, challenged an unprecedented video composition in which the live-action part, which is directed by the cast of gorgeous actors, and the new animation part produced by Toei Animation are interlaced. With the sprinting feeling and vitality sound of RADWIMPS's theme song \"TWILIGHT\" as the background, the charm of \"ONE PIECE\" is drawn from a new perspective and world view.",
