    "SummaryEnglish": "This story takes place a little further in the future—There are now billions of card game players in the world, to an extent where card games have become a necessity, a part of our lives.The protagonist of this story, Aichi Sendo, is a timid boy in his third year of middle school. He had been living his life looking backward rather than forward, trying not to stand out. However, he had one thing that kept him going - the Blaster Blade, a card from a card game that was given to him when he was little. That card is the reason why he begins to engage in Cardfights, something that changes his life drastically. The name of the card game is Vanguard. The game takes place in a different planet called Cray. It is a place similar to our own planet, but unlike planet Earth, Gods and Demons, Dragons and other mythical creatures still roam the land. It is also a world where both Magic and Science have advanced hand in hand. Countries with advances in different fields and cultures rule over different parts of the planet Cray. And due to a never before seen play system, it becomes popular throughout the world. Aichi, immediately attracted by Vanguard, meets friends such as Misaki Togura and Kamui Katsuragi, along with other rivals. Through friendly rivalry with them, Aichi begins to enjoy a fulfilling life. Aichi, however, has a goal: to once again battle with a Vanguard Fighter by the name of Toshiki Kai. Toshiki Kai is an aloof and cold-hearted high schooler who has outstanding abilities in the world of Vanguard. He is also the reason why Aichi started playing the game. For him, Kai is the person who saved him from his boring life and introduced him to Vanguard. In order to get better at Vanguard, Aichi puts his soul into it every day. He wishes that someday, he'll be able to battle Kai and have him recognize his worth.",

After school, Morikawa and his buddy Yūta Izaki steal Aichi's Blaster Blade from him. Aichi runs to a card shop called Card Capital to find that Morikawa lost it in a bet against Kai. It is then that Aichi and Kai meet and play a round of Vanguard with Blaster Blade as the prize. Before the match, Kai gives Aichi Blaster Blade in the hopes of him using it effectively against him. During the course of the match, Kai teaches Aichi the rules of playing Vanguard. As the fight goes on, Aichi reveals that he has met Kai before when summoning his ace, Blaster Blade, which Kai gave to him long ago, stating that it was because of him that he wants to learn more about Vanguard.",

With that in mind, Aichi got absorbed into Vanguard, creating his own deck in the hopes of playing against Kai, who had already moved away by then. Back to the game, Aichi deals a bit of damage to Kai, who retaliates with his ace card, Dragonic Overlord. It wipes out Aichi's units and greatly damages him. All seems lost until Aichi draws a \"Heal Trigger\", which allows Aichi to stay in the game for one last turn. Aichi launches a final attack with Blaster Blade, which breaks through Kai's defenses and deals one more point of damage to Kai, thus giving Aichi the win. A day later, Aichi revisits the card shop. Despite thinking that Kai would not show up after being defeated, Aichi is glad to see that Kai returns.",

Then, after Kamui beats Morikawa in a cardfight, Aichi tries to buy a booster pack. Suddenly, Emi appears, and Kamui immediately falls in love with her. Before Aichi could buy a pack, Emi drags him back home while Kamui looks on, thinking that the two are boyfriend and girlfriend. Later, Aichi buys a booster pack and is pleased to find that the pack contained a Grade 3 card, Solitary Knight, Gancelot. Just then, Kamui shows up and challenges Aichi, demanding to get Emi if he beats him. Although Aichi misunderstands Kamui's intentions, he and Kamui begin their Vanguard fight.

But in the end, Aichi loses to Kamui after he calls his ace card Asura Kaiser. Afterwards, Emi arrives and tries to get Aichi home, and it is then that Kamui learns that the two are actually siblings.

While the fan girls for Brilliant Stars are cheering, Kiriya is still wondering if Aichi has really mastered the Shadow Paladin Deck, while deciding to prove his worth by beating him in front of Ren. With his Pale Moon Deck, Kiriya successfully deals damage to Aichi with his Juggler cards and calling cards from the Soul. Aichi simply takes a few damage and defends himself with a couple of cards, all while taunting Kiriya about Ren giving him the Shadow Paladin Deck because he is strong. After riding Dark Illusionist, Robert, Kiriya is able to deal three damage to Aichi, giving him almost complete control of the match. However, as Miwa states, Aichi is just playing around with Kiriya, as he rides Phantom Blaster Dragon, and calls Blaster Dark to the rear guard to help deal damage. Kiriya is able to defend himself, allowing only one damage as he eagerly calls \"Final Turn\" on Aichi. With Ren watching, Kiriya stands in shock as Aichi completely defends himself and takes no damage. Wondering if Kai is watching his fight, Aichi claims he will show how strong he is, calling his \"Final Turn\" on Kiriya. Calling two more Grade 3 units, Aichi soundly defeats Kiriya, while still muttering that he needs to be even stronger for Kai's recognition. As everyone in the stadium cheers Team Q4 for winning the elimination rounds, Ren congratulates Aichi for winning, while forgetting who Kiriya is. Meanwhile, Kai is seen walking away from watching the match, swearing to himself that he will stop Aichi.",

He learns that not only has Kai's deck been changed to a Narukami deck, but also that Kai has no memory of using a Kagero deck or of Aichi using Royal Paladins. To find some answers, the two have a cardfight. As Aichi struggles to get comfortable with his new Gold Paladin deck, Kai slowly realizes that something is off. Getting his memory back, Kai nonetheless chooses to continue using his current deck, but Aichi is conflicted about using his. Kai tells Aichi that he is bound by his own limits by not wanting to use Gold Paladins and that he needs to break through them. To prove his point, Kai rides Dragonic Kaiser Vermillion, declares \"Final Turn\", and performs Limit Break, an ability that activates when a player has 4 or more damage. With Vermillion's Limit Break, Kai attacks all of Aichi's front-row units in one strike and wins as a result. After the battle, Aichi and Kai watch a commercial advertising the Vanguard Fight Circuit, a worldwide invitational tournament which is sponsored by Takuto Tatsunagi, the young boy that Aichi met before and the one responsible for the phenomena of changing their decks. To use the VF Circuit as a way to reach Takuto, Aichi and Kai go their separate paths. When Aichi goes to Card Capital, he is surprised to learn that Team Q4 has received an invitation to the VF Circuit.",

When Aichi tells him about the invitation, Kamui becomes torn between his own feelings of wanting to participate in the Circuit and his promise to Team Handsome to go with them to the upcoming national tournament. It is ultimately decided to settle things with a cardfight between Aichi and Kamui. If Aichi wins, then Kamui will return to Q4 and enter the VF Circuit. If Kamui wins, then he stays with Handsome. And so, Aichi and Kamui's cardfight ensues. As Aichi tries to get used to his Gold Paladin deck, Kamui puts on the pressure with his slightly-improved Nova Grappler deck, driving Aichi to 5 damage. But this allows Aichi to access the Limit Break of his vanguard Great Silver Wolf, Garmore and increase its power by 5000, thus surprising and defeating Kamui. Although Kamui is initially saddened by this loss and leaving Team Handsome, he is glad to be with Aichi again and have the chance to play in the VF Circuit.",

To prove her wrong, Misaki challenges Rekka to a cardfight. While using the new Angel Feather clan to use cards in her damage zone to her advantage, Rekka criticizes Misaki's deck for being good but still lacking. Rekka then shows Misaki what that missing attribute is when she rides Circular Saw, Kiriel and utilizes its Limit Break to defeat her.

Later that night, after dinner, Ren gathers everyone together and gets them to agree to be in a test of courage, with some having the job of scaring people and the others being put to the test. Shenanigans ensue such as the supposedly-stoic pair of Misaki and Asaka easily getting scared to the point of fainting and Kamui failing to scare Tetsu for being paired with Emi. Aichi and Kai are teamed together to go through the course, but instead of doing so, Kai takes Aichi off on his own and gives him some words of encouragement, which are topped off by a fireworks display.",

The three then undergo a rigorous training regimine, which gives Kamui inspiration to make a new deck revolving around the Raizer series. But once again, in spite of this new deck, Kamui is defeated by Tetsu. After getting coaxed into playing beach volleyball with Ren and Asaka, Misaki cardfights with Ren, with both of them borrowing others' decks. Ren reveals the reason as to why he fights with other people's decks is to not only try and find a more suitable clan for him to use, but to also gain a better understanding of his own deck. With that in mind, Misaki constructs a new Witch-themed Oracle Think Tank deck and defeats Ren, this time borrowing Emi's Bermuda Triangle deck. Aichi turns his focus toward developing a new deck. He finally accepts the gift of Psyqualia and uses it to construct a new deck while also fully embracing the Gold Paladin clan. All the while, Izaki tries to fish but a suntanned Morikawa's swimming gets in the way, and Miwa cardfights (and repeatedly loses to) Kai.

Shin vaguely remembers seeing them before, and it is then that two identical girls appear. They tell him off by saying how that group is actually a powerful team before taking their leave. The Hong Kong Stage officially begins. The unique attribute of this stage is that each cardfight will be 2-on-2 tag-battle style; the first team to deal 9 points of damage instead of the usual 6 to the opposing team is the victor. However, Kamui cannot comprehend the numerous difficult rules, leaving Aichi and Misaki to pair up and take on Team Lao (the group of three men who they met earlier) in the first round. Throughout the fight, the special rules are exhibited and explained: the fighters must only attack the player standing in front of them, they are forbidden to consult their partners and show the cards in their hands to one another, but they are allowed to call guardians from their hands to block for their partners and share damage for Counterblast uses. Team Lao's Terence and Felix both use Tachikaze decks; Terence's Raptor units deliver major damage to Aichi early on in the fight. Using her new Witch deck, Misaki compensates for Aichi by riding Scarlet Witch, CoCo and using various skills to draw more cards, empty her vanguard's soul, and subsequently gain benefits from it. On the sidelines, Shin finally recalls that the members of Team Lao are actually three brothers who therefore have great teamwork with each other. Can Aichi and Misaki overcome the Lao brothers' team synergy and win?",

Remembering Leon's fight with Daigo, Aichi and Kamui do their best to minimize the damage taken from Dreadnought's multi-attacking Aqua Force units. Although Aichi deals damage to Leon, he is unaffected by his attacks. Then, Aichi asks Leon what he means whenever he refers to the \"wind\". It is then revealed that Leon's \"wind\" is actually the power of Psyqualia. In a Psyqualia-induced vision, Leon tells Aichi a tale from long ago about a conflict between the many clans on the planet Cray. This war was eventually resolved by the appearance of the dominating Aqua Force armada. In the human world, the Souryu family had control over the Aqua Force which was used to hold power over the seven seas. However, for unknown reasons, the Aqua Force clan disappeared, and so did the Souryu family's power. The last remaining Souryu members foretold a prophecy of a child who would be \"embraced by the wind\" and restore the family name and the Aqua Force clan to their former glory; Leon believes that child is himself. In a flash, Aichi is shown a vision of two Blue Storm Dragon, Maelstroms, which Leon claims to be his \"whirlwind\" image of victory. Back to the tag fight, Leon rides one Maelstrom and activates its Limit Break. But Aichi uses a perfect guard to block its attack and safely makes it to his next turn. Does Aichi have the same kind of resolve that Leon has, willing to use Psyqualia to win?",

Then, Kamui says that his turn will be the last as he rides another Perfect Raizer, bringing its power up to full potential. However, the usually-mellow Sharlene easily blocks Kamui's attacks and grows angry with his indirect \"Final Turn\" declaration. On Leon's turn, he follows his \"wind\" and calls another Blue Storm Dragon, Maelstrom as a rear-guard, now having two Maelstroms as Aichi had seen through Psyqualia. Leon attacks him with his vanguard Maelstrom powered up via its Limit Break, and Kamui tries to tag guard for Aichi. However, Leon's drive check reveals a stand trigger, giving his vanguard Maelstrom enough power to penetrate Q4's defenses and win the match for Dreadnought. Shortly afterwards, the two teams argue over the value of losing. Leon asks Aichi about what is the path he takes, and Aichi is reminded to make his own path. Leon bids farewell to him and says that they will battle each other again someday. Privately, Jillian asks Leon why he would console his opponents like that, to which he answers by saying it was the \"wind\" that told him to do so. He and Sharlene take an interest in Aichi's gentle \"wind\", which Leon sees as potentially becoming a great \"windstorm\" eventually.

So, Q4 goes to Card Shop PSY and requests for the Ultra Rare girls to cardfight with them for training purposes. They accept, and thus the battles ensue. The first match-up is between Aichi and Kourin, who now uses an Angel Feather deck. Aichi gains the upper hand when he superior rides Pellinore, but Kourin uses her Angel Feathers' skills to swap cards from her damage zone and then calling them. As the fight continues, Kourin antagonistically puts down Aichi by telling him to give up and how he's reached his limits. He proves her wrong and shows his determination when he rides Blond Ezel and activates its Limit Break to defeat her. Despite her harsh words, Kourin is actually glad that Aichi won. Then, the second match-up starts with Kamui against Suiko, who also uses an Angel Feather deck. Although Kamui takes some precaution by not dealing 4 damage to Suiko for fear of Limit Break, she nonetheless plays a card named Doctroid Micros, whose skill is used to purposely give herself 4 damage.

Although Misaki gets the first turn, Rekka gets a grade 3 in play first by superior riding her new ace card, Crimson Impact, Metatron. With its Limit Break, Rekka superior calls more Angel Feathers from her damage zone and pressures Misaki to use a lot of her cards to block against her attacks. The two then have a conversation about how it was Rekka who motivated Misaki to change her deck. Misaki further elaborates that she was hesitant on changing her deck because she thought it would also mean changing the memories associated with her first deck. However, Misaki eventually realized that even if she did change her deck, it would not mean losing what was most important to her. Back to the game, Misaki takes a chance by riding another Scarlet Witch, CoCo, sacrificing attack power for the opportunity of drawing the card she needs to win. Her gamble pays off when she draws and calls a second Silent Tom. With 2 Toms, Misaki renders Rekka unable to guard with any grade 0 units against their attacks and emerges victorious. Afterwards, Team Q4 thanks Ultra Rare for the matches. But before Q4 can leave, three mysterious lights shine from the shop's holographic card displays.

Yuri tries to guard her attack, putting Misaki in the same situation as the last time they fought each other. Misaki decides to take a chance, which pays off when she drive checks a critical and heal trigger, and evens out the damage 4-4. Thanks to Amaterasu and its Limit Break, Misaki ultimately wins. Meanwhile, Kamui continues his battle with Joker X, who rides No Life King, Death Anchor. Kamui defends himself against its terrifying skill with a lot of his cards. On the following turn, Kamui crossrides Illuminal Dragon and activates its Limit Break to stand his remaining units, thus forcing X to not guard against his attack. Kamui defeats Joker X without ever learning his true identity. Winning every match they had, Q4 is crowned the victor of the Japan Stage. After the awards ceremony, Q4 is led to a room where Takuto Tatsunagi explains everything. Expanding on what he previously said to Aichi, a mysterious force has invaded the planet Cray and captured the leaders (Blaster Blade, Blaster Dark, and Dragonic Overlord) of the united clans. The abduction of those three affected the human world by wiping their respective clans from existence. Nevertheless, through the VF Circuit, Takuto has gathered the winners (SIT Genius, New AL4, Dreadnought, and now Q4) of each stage to become the new vanguards for the clans of Cray and lead them in the battle against the mysterious enemy. Takuto transports everyone to a unique dimension that leads to Cray, where they all advance to the \"True Final Stage\".

Leon also says he was the one who let the Royal Paladin, Shadow Paladin, and Kagero clans be sealed away by the enemy. His reasons for doing so are to set the Aqua Force clan free (which was also captured by the same foe), restore the Souryu family to its former glory, and then rule the world. Leon's Psyqualia is amplified by the dark powers of the enemy and blows everyone away. Later, after being knocked unconscious, Q4 awakens and speaks with an injured Takuto, who gives more revelations. He discloses the name of the mysterious enemy: Void, an evil power of emptiness that is currently encompassing the majority of Cray and will make its way to Earth if not stopped. Takuto also states that he manipulated everyone's memories to make them forget about the past relating to the 3 sealed clans in order to introduce the new clans, Gold Paladin and Narukami, for Aichi, Kai, and Ren to later use and get stronger for this upcoming battle to free Cray. After Takuto restores everyone's rightful memories, Q4 leaves him to find and confront Leon, who is currently allowing himself to be engulfed by Void's power. Resolute on saving Blaster Blade after remembering all that the card has done for him, Aichi receives a card that contains Blaster Blade's spirit, which aids the group in their search for Leon. Then, Q4 runs into Team SIT Genius' leader Chris attacking his comrades Lee and Ali. Falling under the negative influence of Psyqualia which is magnified by Void, Chris' obsession with being \"number one\" makes him go mad with power and prevents Q4 from going any further. To save Chris from what he once had undergone, Aichi engages him in a cardfight.",

Curious by how different Aichi's behavior is in the card shop compared to how he acts at school because of a card game, Naoki becomes intrigued to Vanguard. And so, Aichi teaches Naoki about Vanguard through playing an actual match, with the latter being lent a new Narukami trial deck to use from Shin. As they cardfight, Naoki slowly gets immersed into the game. After Aichi eventually wins, Naoki buys the trial deck and hastily leaves in a frustrated manner, which worries Aichi.

The next day, he tries to recruit enough members to officially start the club (needing a minimum of five people, including himself) by handing out leaflets in front of the school. His pleas fall on deaf ears until Kourin agrees to be a member. Her enlistment is followed by several other boys who want to join (only to be with Kourin), but she proposes that anybody who wants to become club members will have to defeat either her and Aichi in cardfights before they can enter. The two easily beat all of the challengers, but then Naoki steps up to play against Kourin with honest feelings of wanting to join the club. With a new Jewel Knight Royal Paladin deck, Kourin battles Naoki, who uses the Eradicator Narukami trial deck he bought a while ago. In the middle of the fight, Naoki reveals that he knew Aichi from when he was in the elementary school division of Miyaji Academy and how he felt guilty for not doing anything to help Aichi who was being bullied at the time. Naoki further explains that seeing how much Aichi has changed because of Vanguard motivated him to find something to be passionate about and ultimately change himself. In the end, Naoki defeats Kourin with the Break Ride ability of Eradicator, Vowing Sword Dragon.

This is an elaborate plan set up by Suwabe to have Ikki defeat Aichi and thereby crush the Cardfight Club members' spirits into not wanting to continue the club. Ikki uses strong Limit Break effects of the latest Spike Brothers to push for victory, but Aichi successfully defends and makes it to his next turn. Aichi then utilizes both the Break Ride of Solitary Liberator, Gancelot and the Limit Break of Liberator of the Round Table, Alfred to overpower and beat Ikki. This loss causes the football team's female cheerleaders to dump Ikki and the Vipers, which devastates them. Later, Naoki asks Ikki's motive for challenging the Cardfight Club, to which he answers that while he was bribed by the student council with a bigger budget for the football team, he mainly did it for the sake of playing against a strong cardfighter like Aichi.

Before the fight, Shingo underestimates Miwa, which ends up being his undoing when Miwa demolishes him and evens the score 2-2. So, it's Aichi vs. Morikawa in the fifth and final game that will decide the fate of the Miyaji Academy Cardfight Club. Given Morikawa's reputation, Misaki thinks that this will be an easy win for Aichi. However, after the two fighters reveal their first vanguards, Aichi is surprised to see Morikawa using Kai's Kagero deck (although Morikawa is not particularly glad about this).",

Although initially mad with using Kai's Kagero deck and not his own, Morikawa nonetheless puts a great amount of pressure on Aichi. All the while, Kai watches the fight as an opportunity to see if his Kagero deck is strong enough against the current Aichi, who strikes back with the Break Ride of Solitary Liberator, Gancelot to empower itself and his rear-guards. Morikawa defends and makes it to his next turn, in which he rides Dragonic Overlord the End. Pairing its Personablast with the Break Ride effect of Dauntless Drive Dragon, Morikawa attacks Aichi with the End three times in a row. Determined to win for the sake of the Cardfight Club, Aichi withstands the onslaught and then uses Gancelot's Break Ride again on the following turn to land a final blow. Aichi emerges victorious over Morikawa, meaning that the Miyaji Academy Cardfight Club wins the intramural match. Aichi and his friends are then congratulated by Hitsue Vanguard Club, with Kai coming to the conclusion that Aichi has indeed grown stronger, perhaps moreso than himself. In spite of being irritated by the Cardfight Club's victory, the Miyaji student council president allows the club to become official and also provides the club with a faculty advisor: Mr. Nakamurabashi, who is clueless about Vanguard. Nevertheless, now that the Cardfight Club has been made official, Aichi and his fellow members look forward to what the future holds for the club.",

Since Aichi was the person who started the club, he reluctantly accepts the position of captain. As for who should be the vice-captain, Shingo is the only person who honestly wants the job while the others are apathetic on the matter. Not wanting to make a hasty decision, Nakamurabashi recommends to hold off until tomorrow on who to elect for vice-captain. After school, Misaki is convinced by her friend Akari to try out for vice-captain. The same happens with Kourin being persuaded by Takuto. The club meets the next day, and when Nakamurabashi asks again for who wants to be the vice-captain, Shingo, Naoki, Misaki, and Kourin all raise their hands. To finally settle things, the four cardfight each other with the overall winner becoming the vice-captain. Misaki defeats Shingo, but Naoki suffers a terrible loss against Kourin. Before the final faceoff between the two girls, Naoki expresses his frustration by saying how bad he feels after finding a passion in Vanguard and yet not initially caring for becoming vice-captain of the Cardfight Club. However, he soon gets over his mortification with a smile. Noticing Naoki's enthusiasm, Misaki, Kourin, and Shingo (much to his chagrin) agree to have Naoki be the vice-captain. As the club walks home from school, Naoki impulsively runs towards a riverside, followed by Aichi and Shingo, where Naoki and Shingo scuffle a bit in the river before all the boys let out one big yell at the sunset.",

The two go to the Cardfight Circle's clubroom where they meet Emi and Mai, who are two of the three members of the circle. Naoki and Mai play a friendly match, in which Naoki shockingly loses to Mai's Bermuda Triangle deck. After the game, he asks her for advice in a somewhat intimidating fashion. But this earns him to be reprimanded by Misaki, who later enters with Aichi. Not knowing that Aichi and Emi are siblings, Shingo gets offended when he hears Emi talking to Aichi in a casual manner, which causes her to get mad with Shingo. This leads to a cardfight pitting Emi, using a PR♥ISM-themed Bermuda Triangle deck, against Shingo, who is using a Narukami deck this time. Although Shingo deals 5 damage to her, Emi nonetheless uses the Break Ride of PR♥ISM-Image, Vert to empower her vanguard PR♥ISM-Promise, Labrador and then returns three of her rear-guards to her hand. She then activates the Limit Break of Labrador to call three rear-guards from her hand to the field, which gives Labrador more power and critical value. Along with getting a critical trigger, Emi thoroughly defeats Shingo. Just as he requests for Aichi to avenge him, Ultra Rare's Rekka Tatsunagi appears in a Miyaji Academy uniform.",

The club is greeted by Tetsu Shinjou, who leads everyone into the school where they watch a cardfight between Asaka Narumi and Leon Soryu, much to Aichi's surprise. Asaka tries to end the game by using Starlight Melody Tamer, Farah's Personablast and the Pale Moon strategy of superior calling units from the soul during the battle phase for additional attacks. Despite the multi-pronged assault, Leon defends himself and then rides Last Card, Revonn on top of Blue Flight Dragon, Trans-core Dragon.

The script is loosely based on The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter but with Vanguard units; Aichi is given the role of the bamboo cutter (Little Sage, Marron), Misaki is the heroine (CEO Amaterasu), Naoki is the villain (Eradicator, Vowing Sword Dragon), and Kourin is the hero (King of Knights, Alfred). Although Kourin is seemingly busy with her job as an idol, Misaki notices that she is in fact preparing for the play. However, on the day of rehearsal, Kourin does not show up, which leads the club (except Misaki) to think that she is not serious about the play and that Aichi should take the role of Alfred. The day of the School Festival finally arrives, and all of Aichi's friends have come. Unfortunately, Kourin is not at school. To make matters worse, the club is informed by Suwabe that the club's time of performance is actually an hour earlier than scheduled. As the club hastily sets up for the play, Misaki learns from Akari why Kourin did not show up for rehearsal. The play then goes underway with Shingo narrating the story.

Worried about the dream, he then goes to school and is relieved to see his friends are there, except for Kourin. After school, Aichi arranges for the Cardfight Club to meet at Card Capital. Naoki goes back into the classroom to retrieve his bag and then decides to follow the student council's secretary. He is eventually led into a strange hidden room where he sees the secretary talking with an unknown person about monitoring the Cardfight Club. At Card Capital, Aichi expresses his worry to his friends over Kourin's absence. Naoki enters the shop, but he is acting like a completely different person. As if possessed by a dark force, Naoki challenges Aichi to a cardfight, which he accepts. The fight reaches a turning point when Naoki declares \"Final Turn\" and does a Crossbreak Ride with Eradicator, Vowing Saber Dragon \"Reverse\". This move allows Naoki to retire all of Aichi's rear-guards and increase his overall attack power. Determined to return Naoki to his former self, Aichi withstands Naoki's assault and rides Wolf Fang Liberator, Garmore on the following turn. He uses its Limit Break to superior call more units from his deck to refill his entire field, winning the game for Aichi. Naoki collapses and then gets up but with no memory of what just happened. Moreover, when Kai picks up the Vowing Saber Dragon \"Reverse\" card, it mysteriously vanishes.",

He not only tells them the solution to returning Reversed fighters to normal is defeating them in cardfights, but he also informs them that he plans on going to fight Kai and wants Aichi to join him. He agrees, but then Leon proposes to have a fight instead. Shortly into the battle, Leon calls the fight off, noting that Aichi's heart is locked by the thought of having to fight Kai. Leon leaves after further deeming Aichi as being unable to achieve victory in his current state and unworthy of fighting alongside him. While Aichi looks inside himself for answers, Naoki follows Leon outside and says that he wants to go with him in Aichi's place. Leon decides to test Naoki's skills in a cardfight with Shingo observing them. Meanwhile, Jun Mutsuki gathers his fellow underground fighters in an effort to counterattack the Reversed fighters until Miwa appears before him. Quickly realizing Miwa's Reversed state, Jun cardfights him. Although he drives Miwa to the brink of defeat, Jun is unable to deal the final blow to him. Miwa wins using Dauntless Dominate Dragon \"Reverse\", leaving the now-Reversed Jun to take on the other underground fighters. After beating Naoki several times, Leon finally decides to leave until Shingo intervenes. Before departing, Leon recommends for Naoki and Shingo to take care of Aichi. So, the two decide to train in preparation for the big confrontation.",

The two then decide to go and reclaim Miyaji Academy from the Reversed fighters inhabiting it. They encounter Maki, who summons all of the Reversed fighters (except Kamui and Kourin). Together, Naoki and Shingo take on all of the fighters, defeating them one by one. However, unbeknownst to Naoki as he continues fighting, Shingo loses to Maki. After beating the last of the Reversed fighters, Naoki searches for Shingo but then comes across Naitou and Suwabe. Soon after, Naoki finds Shingo but is shocked to discover that the latter is Reversed. Determined to bring his friend back, Naoki engages the Reversed Shingo in a cardfight. Naoki gains an early advantage, but Shingo strikes back with Covert Demonic Dragon, Hyakki Vogue \"Reverse\" and its Limit Break. With the Reversed Shingo denouncing all sense of friendship he had with the Cardfight Club, Naoki begins to lose the will to fight until he hears the real Shingo's voice, motivating him to continue the battle...",

Naoki, Naito, and Suwabe then take Shingo inside the school where he regains his senses. Meanwhile, Aichi thinks about what Leon said to him as he walks to Card Capital. Once there, he wonders where Naoki and Shingo are, and Misaki deduces that the two have gone off on their own to take on any Reversed fighters. Back at Miyaji Academy, Naoki remembers the secret room where he previously followed Maki to, and it is there that Naoki engages her in a cardfight while Shingo, Naito, and Suwabe watch. As the two wage battle, Maki reveals she knows about how Naoki was previously a loner like herself and further exclaims that he should embrace the darkness of Link Joker like she has. As Naoki gets caught up in Maki's image, Shingo reminds Naoki that he is not alone. Those words snap Naoki out of the image; he then goes on to beat Maki with Tempest Bolt Dragon. Her loss means that the last of Miyaji Academy's Reversed fighters have been dealt with, resulting in the gate floating above the school dissipating
