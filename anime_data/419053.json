  "SummaryEnglish": "According to the myth of the legend, the young master Weisu changed the concept of the world, created a new era, and made the position of the demon exorcist extremely noble and highly respected. But this era of \"silver drawing masters\" quickly declined overnight, and everything about silver drawing techniques disappeared. This era, which only existed in legend, aroused Yang Yao's interest. As he embarked on the road of backtracking, he gradually found that the original matter was far from over.",
