  "SummaryEnglish": "The research organization code-named \"Mattamore\" is like a never-ending nightmare, leaving all involved thrilling in terror. With this setting, the ordinary-yet-unusual university graduate Bai Xi, and the mysterious and powerful, nigh-omnipotent esper Han Zhuo, along with a group of steadfast friends, set out on a spectacular path of salvationâ€”those dark corners that the sunlight can never reach, always need someone to rend the the first tear.",
