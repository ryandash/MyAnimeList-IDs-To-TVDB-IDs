Inari then reveals he is a god, who created the universe alongside his brother, the head priest, and his father. Saying that he wanted Koto to grow up to be someone he can live on through, Inari suddenly stabs both Koto and the priest with his sword, putting Koto under his control as she starts destroying Kyoto, causing harsher effects on the other parralels.

After coming across Yase, who praises how he always thought of Kyoto, Yakushimaru rushes to Koto's side and brings her back to her senses with the beads of creation he got from Inari, which he believes can save Kyoto.",
