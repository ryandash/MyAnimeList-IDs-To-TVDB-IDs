A new unified organization called OWEL leads people, and a new system called \"Elsie\" (or \"LC\") has now taken the place of marriage. Appearing before Akira after he wakes is an android named Yugure, who looks strikingly similar to his girlfriend Towasa. Yugure immediately proposes marriage to a baffled Akira. Akira then decides to go on a journey with Yugure, as he believes Towasa must still exist in this world.",
