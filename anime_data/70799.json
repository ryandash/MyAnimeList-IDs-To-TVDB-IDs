The rest of the BladeBreakers, including Hilary, keep harping on him to continue until he gets it right. But Tyson has had enough and quits! It seems the BladeBreakers are finished! Then, Hilary comes up with an idea! She tells the guys to take a day off and invites them to an afternoon barbecue with Grandpa playing the part of the Chef. At first Tyson wants nothing to do with it, but finally he relents and joins in. After lunch, the kids relax by the river while Grandpa fishes. Suddenly he hooks a big one and gets dragged in the water! The kids run to the rescue, however, a group of four new teenagers appear out of nowhere and rescue Gramps. After a brief conversation, our heroes realize these new kids are also bladers, so Tyson challenges their leader, Kane, to a battle. After a fierce fight, it ends in a tie and the new kids leave. Tyson thinks he made a new friend, but as it turns out, Kane is the leader of the new Team Psykick recruited by Gideon!!",

Doctor K tempts Queen into using a vicious new attack ring she's created called 'The Shredder'. Queen uses it against Max, and nearly grinds Draciel into a pulp. But with Max using the new Draciel V2 Judy gave him, and having the will of the crowd and his teammates behind him, Max overcomes this attack, destroys Queen's Beyblade, and wins the first match of the best-of-two. Next up, is King versus Tyson, who has an improved Beyblade of his own, thanks to Kenny's ingenuity. Angered by the failure of Doctor K's attack ring, King dissolves his partnership with the scientist and vows to combat Tyson without her assistance. The resulting match is an intense, high-powered battle that's not only fair, but completely up for grabs. When Tyson's blade begins faltering for some unknown reason, the combatants spot Doctor K high above the stadium. Through a rooftop window, she's using a particle beam to try and disable Dragoon. Disgusted by her attempt to throw the match, King and Tyson put aside their differences, combine their Bit-Beasts' attack, and destroy her weapon. With the playing field even again, the Blader’s resume their match and Tyson wins. King's display of honesty generates a newfound respect for King and Queen from the Bladebreakers.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "The Beyblade World Tag Team Championships are about to start in Rome as Barthez busily prepares his team for the big event. He's even invited a television news crew to document his efforts as a coach. Unfortunately, Barthez's personality slips through on occasion revealing the truth about how much a tyrant he really is. The Italian tournament begins and it's Barthez Battalion against White Tiger X. Ray starts for the Tigers going up against Claude. In mere seconds, Ray pulls off a victory that sets off alarm bells among the other competitors who think something is fishy. The second battle has Lee and Miguel pitted against each other. It doesn't take long for Miguel to win the match for Barthez Battalion which sets up the third and final round- Miguel against Ray. This battle starts off with Ray on the offensive, but suddenly, blades spring out of Miguel's blade and KABOOM. Miguel wins. Kenny, watching this on a monitor, is very suspicious of the victory just as Hiro enters to give the line-up for the next battle, which doesn't include Tyson.",
