    "SummaryEnglish": "Otonokizaka High School stands on the border of three cities: Akihabara—a pop culture mecca that's evolving by the minute; Kanda—a conservative, cultured city where history and tradition reign supreme; and Jinbo—a quiet area reserved for a more mature, sophisticated population. Amidst this culture clash, the school now faces closure due to the enrollment of fewer and fewer students. With the school planning to close within three years, nine female students come together with one thing in mind—form a pop idol group to revive the school's popularity and keep it from shutting down. \"In order to protect our beloved school, there's only one thing we can do... become pop stars!\" Their goal is simple: Become an overnight sensation and use their nationwide media exposure to promote their school and bring in a wave of new students to the ailing area. A simple but solid plan, they figure. Naturally, they're nervous and wonder if this plan can really succeed, but for better or worse their new journey has begun...",

As Honoka decides to investigate UTX, she finds it attracts a lot of students due a school idol group known as A-Rise. Honoka decides that the best way to save her school is to start an idol group themselves, though Umi isn't keen on the idea. As Honoka becomes downhearted, she spots a talented singer and pianist and redoubles her efforts, whilst Umi inevitably gives in and joins Kotori in partaking in Honoka's idea.
