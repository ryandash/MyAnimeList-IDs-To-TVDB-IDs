    "TitleEnglish": "Re: Cutie Honey",
    "SummaryEnglish": "A mysterious organization known as Panther Claw make their presence known by terrorizing Tokyo and giving the cops a run for their money. Police are further baffled by the appearance of a lone cosplaying vigilante who thwarts all of Panther Claw's evil schemes before disappearing. That cosplayer is Honey Kisaragi, the result of the late Professor Kisaragi's prize experiment. A master of disguise, Honey can magically alter her physical appearance and outfits. But with a push of the heart-shaped button on her choker, she transforms herself into Cutie Honey, the scantily-clad, sword-wielding warrior of love and justice.",
    "TitleJapanese": "Re：キューティーハニー",
    "SummaryJapanese": "タイトルにある＜Re:＞はRETURNやRENEWALなど様々な意味を持つが、実写映画との相互RESPONCEとして、庵野秀明がまとめた膨大なコンセプトメモから基本設定を踏襲しつつも、映画とは一味違う新たなストーリーを映像化する。原作では空中元素固定装置、庵野版では＜Ｉシステム＞となっているハニーの能力や、映画では表現しきれなかった細かい設定もアニメならではの描写で補完しつつ再構成。\n各話監督には、今石洋之、伊藤尚往、摩砂雪を迎え、かつて庵野秀明が監督した『トップをねらえ！』と同じ三部構成で、バカで破天荒な始まりから、次第にシリアスでハードになっていく展開にも注目！",
