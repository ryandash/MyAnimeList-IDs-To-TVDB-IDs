When the two people who were never supposed to meet encountered one another at a night party, the story that should have ended with Scarlet's death began anew. Although their relationship only began out of mutual interest, they soon became true partners in an effort to unravel the mysteries of a grand conspiracy borne out of the past, that still has a vicious grip on the present.",
