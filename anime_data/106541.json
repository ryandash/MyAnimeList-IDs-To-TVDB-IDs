                    "SummaryEnglish": "As the show opens, news helicopters are flitting around the giant, monolithic Gate, and a reporter's frantic voice can be heard trying to describe its impact to viewers. Futilely, he tries to speculate on the origin of the Gate, but is abruptly cut off when a flying Remnant gets too close and destroys the helicopter. On the ground, people stare in awe, overwhelmed by a feeling of helplessness. Exhausted, Hazumi struggles to climb up the side of the Gate. \"Wait for me, Takumi! Don't die!\" she screams."
