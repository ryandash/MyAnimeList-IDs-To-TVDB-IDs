    "SummaryEnglish": "The blind adolescent Su Yun was raised in Tianmen Town, the Sky City, Yuanshuo Country, in an outlying rural wasteland. He followed a fox to study the ancient texts. Su Yun, encouraged by Qiu Shuijing, left Tianmen Town to study at Shuofang City, but unintentionally became entangled in a plot that had been hatched 150 years earlier. The Seven Great Families, the Old Master of Shuobei, the Sage of Shuofang, the Great Emperor of the Eastern Capital... Let's witness how Su Yun topples this \"chessboard\" and defends one side of the people when numerous forces are competing for control and profit and putting the populace in peril.(Bstation)",
