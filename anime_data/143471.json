In her debut Sayaka wins a women's judo tournament with ease and publicly announces that she is dissatisfied because her real goal is to defeat Yawara. Meanwhile Yawara pays no attention as she concentrates on perfecting beef Stroganoff as a dish that she wishes to cook for a future boyfriend, but is dismayed by Sayaka's public challenge. Shinnosuke, who has been hired by Sayaka to be her judo coach, is revealed to have severe stage fright when he runs off to in a bathroom to hide from reporters at the tournament press conference. Later, Shinnosuke discovers that Yawara might be the \"strong girl\" that Sayaka is obsessed with and also the granddaughter of his judo idol Jigoro Inokuma (Shinnosuke keeps Jigoro's book \"Judo Is Not Built in A Day!\" at all times.)",

Seeing elbow scrapes on Yawara that could be caused by judo exercise arouses Shinnosuke's suspicion even more. However, Yawara shows no interest in judo and instead talks about bargain sales and beef stroganoff; even when he puts judo moves on her, Yawara shows no reaction (which she intentionally represses). Later, Yawara has a chance encounter with a member of her high school's judo club, and kindly offers to wash their soiled judo uniforms; the judo club is run by Hanazono, a big senior student who is very emotional and cries easily. Hanazono is upset that Musashiyama high school's judo club has fallen by the wayside and now only has weaklings as members, with another practice match coming up with the rival Ganryuji high school, which has a habit of belittling his team. Jigoro befriends Hanazono and cooks up a scheme to have Yawara \"join\" the judo club by kidnapping a member of the judo club and inducing Yawara to drop off the judo uniforms. When Yawara arrives, she is conscripted to be a temporary placeholder member for the judo club by Hanazono, who does not know her judo abilities initially. The practice match is changed to a elimination arrangement, forcing Yawara to participate reluctantly as a placeholder in the match; Yawara is worried that she will miss the bargain sale that she had previously arranged to attend with her friends. The rival Ganryuji team agrees to the change in match arrangement because they want to have a chance to wrestle a girl.",

Later, Yawara and Shinnosuke go on a date at a park, which is constantly disrupted by his spotting Sayaka and other other love interests at the park. Shinnosuke later simply runs off when he spots Sayaka again at a cafe. Jigoro goes to a TV station with a grandiose \"3-part plan\" for the media debut of Yawara, but is rebuffed by the station because of his unreasonable demands; Jigoro also seems to be using the opportunity to promote his own biography as much as Yawara.

Shinnosuke tells Sayaka that she cannot beat Yawara for the time being; Yawara seems equally upset by this as by Shinnosuke's possibly romantic interest with her rival. Sayaka manipulates her dad to invite Jigoro for dinner and to hire him as her judo coach; however, Jigoro is only interested in scoring a free meal at an expensive French restaurant, at which he ate a huge dinner and even took doggie bag home. Meanwhile, after being rescued by Matsuda on the motorcycle, Yawara cooks beef stroganoff for him at his untidy bachelor's apartment and confides in him about her history with judo--she has been a judo child prodigy but really only wants a normal life as a girl.

In fact, Jigoro has refused the Honami offer with his usual excuse that he does not teach \"weaklings.\" The refusal shocks the Honamis but does not faze Shinnosuke, who finally secures Jigoro's autograph on both his book and jacket. Meanwhile, seeing that Yawara is upset by the false news concerning Jigoro, Matsuda takes her to an amusement park, where they also cannot escape strangers who bother Yawara due to her new celebrity status. To help Yawara, Matsuda cooks up a scheme in which his newspaper would set up a match against the heavyweight judoka Yuki Tohdoh, who weighs 20 kg (44 lb) more than Yawara, in her debut; they believe that if Yawara intentionally throws the match, the loss will cause the media to dismiss her as a judoka and henceforth leave her alone. At home, Yawara is relieved that Jigoro is not \"abandoning\" her to be Sayaka's coach, but is troubled by her omission of not telling her grandfather that she intends to lose at the upcoming public debut match.

Yawara tells Matsuda that her mother has been looking for her father after he disappeared, and only returns home a few times a year. Despite the losing scheme, Matsuda is still having dreams of fans cheering for Yawara. Jigoro and Yuki Tohdoh, who talks, eats, and looks like sumo wrestler, have a udon eating contest as they boast by turn how few seconds it would take for the contestants to defeat each other. Yawara's friends are concerned that she will be hurt or killed in the match (not knowing true abilities), and urge that she just needs to \"cry to stop the match.\" They also try to make her more fashionable by tying a yellow ribbon to her head.

As Yawara continues to fake her way through the match, Jigoro becomes suspicious and finally realizes that Yawara is trying to lose; Matsuda for his part is unable to continue watching the fake defeat and decides to leave, meeting an unknown woman on the outside asking about the match. As Yawara is about to \"lose\" the match, she spots her mother (the unknown woman) peeking through the windows and reflexively throws Yuki Tohdoh in a split second for an ippon win. After the match, Shinnosuke cannot stop his womanizing ways and invite Yawara's three friends for more discussion about judo over coffee. Yawara and mother flee from the reporters after the victory, which was not known to Matsuda until the reporters confront him about helping them flee (Matsuda up until then had been intending to resign and go back to work for his family hostel at Yamagata). Yawara and her mother, Tamao, return home for dinner, and Tamao tells Yawara that it does not matter whether she does judo or not, and that there are other ways to be strong.

Yawara asks her mother if she was \"attracted to many men at the same time\" when she was younger. Mistaking her surprisingly good mood for having given up on Mitsuba College (because she must have failed the entrance exam), Jigoro takes her to visit Saikai College to visit Coach Yuutenji and the college president, but Yawara bursts their collective bubble by categorically stating that she will not attend Saikai.

Shortly after he took over Kaneko's Kyudodan dojo, he saves a man who is about to hang himself due to a bad romance. One day Kaneko's uncle (father's older brother) Toranosuke, a tea ceremony master rather than a judoka, comes to visit with an offer for Kaneko to marry his best student and carry on as his successor; this is supposed to the will of Kaneko's father, Ushio Umanosuke. However, Jigoro is also thinking of proposing in the future to Kaneko. The uncle and Jigoro do not get along, as they argue over whether a teacup or (judo) tatami is more important. Toranosuke tricks Jigoro into saying that he values judo over any woman or marriage, which is inadvertently confirmed by Jigoro who has to attend his first All Japan Championship. Kaneko tells him that she will accompany her uncle to be engaged to his student. In the final match, Jigoro is pinned helplessly by his opponent until the formerly suicidal young man encourages him with the prospect of proposing to Kaneko at the Ueno train station as the Japan champion. Inspired, Jigoro wins the match and rushes to the station. On board the train, he at first proposes to the wrong woman, only to find that Kaneko never boarded the train and is running aside it to catch his attention. According to Jigoro, Kaneko runs so fast that she catches up to the train at the next station, where they exchange their marriage vow. In addition, the suicidal young man was Sato Daisaku, who became an important prime minister during the modernization of Japan, all entirely thanks to Jigoro. Yawara does not believe in the story, and the reporters also long left the \"interview.\"",

To compensate for his weakness, he has been traveling and training all over the country to become stronger. Kojiro tells Matsuda that his letter contains important tips for Yawara in her final match. Kojiro runs away, and Matsuda is detained by the arena police to file a police report as they believe he is a victim of an assault by Kojiro. In their hard fought match, Jody is leading at first, and Yamashita and Jigoro are puzzled that Teleshikova has not used any of her powerful throws. Jody hurts her foot with 1 minute left and Teleshikova relentlessly attacks her injury with repeated foot sweeps. Despite being in severe pain, Jody refuses to give up and tries a desperate move that almost wins her the victory, but Teleshikova finally unleashes her fearsome throw with 1 second left to win by an ippon.",

Kuniko tries to give the \"fan letter\" to Yawara, but she ignores her as she is in a mental zone. Yawara enters the match energized by a desire for revenge. Although Yawara scores 2 quick yukos agaisnt Teleshikova using different moves, Jigoro is not happy and says if it keeps up, Yawara might lose.

In her semiconsciousness, Yawara remembers her throwing Kojiro at 5 and apologizes to him, and finally she wakes up on hearing Matsuda yelling for her to get up (which she mistakes for Kojiro's voice). As the match continues, Teleshikova engages her relentless leg sweeps, and Jigoro is angry that Yawara is still fighting for revenge and not using her head. Meanwhile, as Jody is about to be transported to the hospital, she instead escapes into the arena to cheer Yawara on. Teleshikova unleashes another uranage for a yuko and another throw for yuko, now leading Yawara in match points. Yawara is able to score a waza ari after seeing Jody cheering her on, but Jody collapses right afterwards and has to be carried out on a stretcher. Jigoro is so angry by Yawara's revengeful display that he tries to stop the match, saying that he does not want to win a gold metal in such a shameful fashion, but is stopped by Yamashita.",

Right afterwards, Jigoro angrily pulls off Yawara off the stage and refuses to let Yawara attend the award ceremony. The media begins to ask about the rumor that Kojiro left because of being thrown by a 5-year-old Yawara.

With the second opponent, Yoko also scores a surprising yuki and thinks she has won, arguing with the ref because she does not know judo rules; on 2nd contact, the Tsukushi judoka (Kurokawa, a national runnerup) realizes Yoko is an one-trick pony and quickly disposes of her.

Her opponent is the favorite in the division, and has studied Fujiko's \"Swan Lake\" technique to counter it. With less than 20 seconds left, Fujiko's only chance is her new unperfected \"Nutcracker\" technique. On hearing Yawara's spur-of-the-moment promise to go to Yugoslavia with her, Fujiko pulls off her Nutcracker with 1 second left for a miraculous comeback. After defeating her 2nd opponent, Fujiko is in cloud nine as she dreams about Yugoslavia and prances in her ballet moves while waiting for the semifinals, and can hardly hear Yawara's advice about her tough 3rd opponent. Likewise, Jigoro has a bad feeling about the semifinals (in part based on his noodle timing). Overconfident, Fujiko rushes to do her Nutcracker, only to be countered and suffers a waza ari and a yuko; her confidence is crushed again. Though she has not been taught any pinning moves by Jigoro, Fujiko's desire to go to Yugoslavia is so strong that she invents a new Osaekomi pin on the fly, but it is unclear whether she can hold on.",

Matsuda also tells her she cannot lead a normal life wherever she goes and can never get away from judo. Tsurukame president confesses to Yawara that they lied about having a judo dojo to lure her into signing with the company, which does not deflate Yawara because she can work a normal job. Yawara is matched with an old rival from Tsukushi, Ogaki, who has been armed with a secret technique developed by her coach to counter Yawara. Matsuda recognizes Yawara's \"smile\" as the same one during her debut, when her intent was to fake a loss so she could leave judo. But Matsuda is completely wrong, as Yawara was not about to throw the match and beats her opponent smoothly anyway. She runs off to catch the Tsurukame people to accept their offer, but they had already left. Tsurukame's president has become a Yawara fan and decides that they will never lie to her, though they believe she is heading for Sakai. As her finals match begins, Fujiko is at a loss, not knowing that she has never been taught how to deal with a lefthanded opponent.",

Fujiko executes an come from behind ippon by finally grasping Obayashi's back collar, but it is ruled out of bounce. At the last second, Fujiko wins a yuko, and it is left to the judges' decision, and they ruled in favor of Obayashi. As a result, although she has been accepted to Saikai, she would not be going to the world championships in Yugoslavia. She tries to put up a brave face at the post-match celebration, and is overdrinking as usual to compensate, though it is Hanazono who gets drunk and kisses Shinnosuke by mistake while calling out, \"Fujiko...swan!\" Yawara offers to stay with Fujiko for the night, but Fujiko says she is all right and does not need company.

Yawara, concerned about Fujiko, goes to visit her in the morning but is told that she has left already. Yawara then visits Tsurukame office to accept its job, while Coach Yuutenji calls Jigoro to tell her Saikai has approved Yawara and Fujiko's acceptance pending an entrance exam formality. Yawara encounters Hanazono speaking to Saikai, who confesses that she fears always being a failure and a burden on Yawara; Hanazono cheers her up by telling Yawara sees her as a friend and needs her support. Jigoro reads in the news that Teleshikova dominated the recent European free weight judo championship and tells Yawara, but it does not \"stir her blood\" like he expected. Yawara cooks special food to bribe Jigoro so she could break her new job news to him: gazpacho, which Jigoro renames \"gas blasto,\" and cordon bleu, which he mistakes for tonkatsu (Japanese pork cutlets), calling it \"condor brr\".

Fujiko sees the cup competitors at the airport and is completely intimidated, especially by Teleshikova, and is glad she is not competing. She dances ballet before training. She and Jody bond over their big-eating boyfriend/husband. Matsuda rushes home on news that his father has suffered a stroke.

He launches into another semi-fictional story that starts in 1936, after he won his first Japan Judo Championship. Davis, a blond giant from America with a cheerful laugh and personality, challenges his dojo, and after being defeated, becomes his student at the dojo (Jigoro calls him \"Debeso\"). They also compete at eating and telling tall tales about beating bears and whales. Davis turns to be famous a heavyweight wrestler (though Jigoro has never heard of him) who tells him about the Berlin Olympics. He is able to endure all of Jigoro's vigorous training, but is banished when he gives a Kaneko a misinterpreted innocent kiss after she sews an outfit for him. Davis faces off with a dozen rival dojo members and defeats them. Afterwards, Davis and Jigoro have a match before Davis goes off to the Olympics, and they duel to a near draw after 3 hrs, until Jigoro puts him in an arm hold, which he releases to that Davis can go to Berlin without injury. This is the origin of Jigoro's interest in an Olympic metal, which is not to debut for judo until 1992 in Barcelona.",

Jigoro still hopes for Yawara to lose, and wants Fujiko to fight with full spirit. As she begins the contest, Fujiko reflects on how much judo has changed her life after meeting Yawara, and she feels almost as if she is doing ballet at her peak. Fujiko follows Jigoro’s advice and attacks first, but is quickly defeated; however, she is happy in defeat and to discover how strong her friend really is. The gap between them at this point is still too great. Contrary to Matsuda’s fears and Shinnosuke’s prediction, Yawara does not hold back and has no problem throwing Fujiko. Matsuda realizes how little he knows about Yawara, who cut the match short because she is kind and did not want to humiliate her friend with a long match and false hopes.

Yawara decides to help by talking to Hanazono about why he is shutting out Fuchiko, but initially misinterprets his “I have no honor” (really meaning that he’s underachieved in judo compared to the 2 women) to mean that he’s cheating on Fujiko. In fact, Hanazono is unable to meet with Fuchiko because he thinks it’s his last chance to be a starter on the Ebitendo judo team and must block out all distractions, including Fujiko, until he makes good as a judoka.

In the practice match, Hanazono is surprised to discover how fast he can read Yoshida’s moves and realizes how good his training has been under Jigoro and Yawara. Hanazono leaves a voicemail with Fujiko to announce he’s entering the Shoujiko cup and promises that if he wins, he’ll “show himself” to Fujiko. Fujiko worries that what that will mean to them if Hanazono doesn’t win... At the college championships, the Ebitendo team loses quickly but Hanazono wins and continues to the next round as an individual. Fujiko, however, hears false news of his loss.

However, before the finals, he’s experiencing great stage fright like Fujiko used to get, looking like “a gorilla with a bellyache,” as the stakes are bigger for him with Fujiko on the line.

Jigoro’s scheme to motivate Yawara by pasting pictures of Sayaka winning at tournaments on her bedroom wall apparently backfires. However, eventually Yawara trips over volumes of Matsuda’s articles left behind by Jigoro, and when she reads them, she is moved by Matsuda’s passionate support for her. She stands up Shinnosuke at the last minute and goes to meet Matsuda at the café, but it is already closed. When she leaves there by bus, Matsuda spots her and runs after the bus, and she tells him she would pick up judo again and he tells her he won’t quit journalism.",

Moreover, Sayaka deploys a vicious arm-pulling jyuji gatame attack as a final “death trap,” which dislocates Yawra’s right elbow. Yawara only has her left hand to attack with, and Yawara hesitates with a counterattack because of her memory of using the same technique against her father when she was a child, being blocked psychologically. Matsuda’s cries of “winning the Barcelona gold” and “not crushing his dream” counters her inhibition, however, and she goes for the leg lift tomoe nage, which earns her a yuko.

She still believes that there’s nothing she wants that she can’t get. Only Shinnosuke is there to see her cry and being vulnerable for the first time, and he kisses her.
