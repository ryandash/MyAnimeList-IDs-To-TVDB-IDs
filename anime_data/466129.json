  "SummaryEnglish": "Luna Ishikawa is a dark and mysterious vampire—or so she'd like her new classmates to believe. The truth is, while she may be one of the not-so-mythical bloodsuckers, she doesn't really live up to the hype. She's short and clumsy, and she can't even suck blood properly! So when her classmate Tatsuta Ootori discovers her little “drinking problem,” he can't help but lend a hand. Can he nurse Luna from the small, timid animal she is into a fearsome creature of the night?!",
