    "SummaryEnglish": "HFIL is a CGI-animated webseries created and produced by Team Four Star, with animation provided by animator/Perfect Cell enthusiast DevilArtemis. It is a spinoff/sequel series to Dragon Ball Z Abridged, akin to their other DBZ-themed webseries, Dragon ShortZ. Welcome to HFIL! Short for the Home For Infinite Losers, this cul-de-sac deep in the bowels of Hell is home to the biggest baddies the world of DBZA has to offer... and also Raditz. Oh, and the former Namekian Grand Elder (Super Kami) Guru. Unable to utilize the full potential of his Perfect form due to a Ki-supressing ankle bracelet and stuck sharing a house with the aforementioned Raditz and Guru, Cell must now adjust to his new suburban (after)life and deal with all the shenanigans that entails... and perhaps even be deemed good enough to leave.",
