    "TitleEnglish": "Dragon ShortZ",
    "SummaryEnglish": "Dragon ShortZ is a CGI-based animated series being produced by Team Four Star. The series tells the stories of the characters of Dragon Ball — or, more specifically, Dragon Ball Z Abridged — that went untold in canon between the Cell and Buu sagas. Dragon ShortZ is thus much less action-oriented than DBZA, and instead focuses on slice-of-life stories like Goten's birth or Krillin and 18's relationship. The TFS cast reprises their roles.",
