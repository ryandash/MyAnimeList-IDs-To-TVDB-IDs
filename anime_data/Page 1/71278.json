    "SummaryEnglish": "Hellsing is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kouta Hirano. An Anime Series was produced by Gonzo. Directed by Umanosuke Iida, and it was broadcast on Japan's Fuji Televison. // Plot: Vampires exist. It is the duty of Hellsing, an organization sponsored by the British government, to hide that frightening fact and protect the blissfully unaware populace. Along with its own personal army, Hellsing also has a few secret weapons. Alucard, an incredibly powerful vampire, has been controlled by Hellsing for years. Although he dislikes being a servant to the Hellsing family, he certainly enjoys his job as Hellsing’s vampire exterminator. Seras is a fledgling vampire and a former police woman. Although reluctant to embrace her new self, she is still a valuable member of the organization. Integra Hellsing, the current leader, is usually fully capable of fulfilling her duty, but lately, vampire activity has been on the rise. Unfortunately, the cause is more alarming than anything she could have imagined...",

Though having the same mission as Hellsing, the two organizations are sworn enemies, and when Alucard shows up, a heated battle takes place. One would think a human would be no match for the likes of a vampire, Anderson proves to have more than one trick up his sleeve.",
