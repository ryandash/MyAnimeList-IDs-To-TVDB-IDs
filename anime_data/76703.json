He eventually finds the perfect hideaway: a huge mountain named Mt. Quena, surrounded by steep cliffs that are practically impossible to scale, but in its top is a forest and a freshwater lake that makes for a near-utopia for all the Bug Pokémon living there. This is a perfect fit for Mewtwo's band, so thus they settle in the top of Mt. Quena and begin a new, safe life, with Mewtwo watching over as their guardian, as he feels they cannot belong in the world as they were not born in it (he seems particularly close to the Pikachu and Meowth clones, possibly reflecting how important their templates were in his change of heart).",

As everyone is asleep, the rocket blasts off. Pikachu is hit in the nose with a mallet, which startles him, and then Pikachu's electric shock begins to power the space ship. In mid-air Team Rocket try to abandon the ship, but they are on the wrong side and break off to crash into the land. Ash and the group manage to use Bulbasaur to wrap its vines around the point of a skyscraper, and they swing to safety. The ship soon crashes in the woods, and Oswald",

Brock tells him not to give up, and so he does not. Meanwhile, Team Rocket are trying selling things to get money. They seem to be good at it as they sell out of official Pokémon League badges. Meowth is up to his usual tricks and they are not official. He is in fact making them out of bottle caps. They decide to try a distraction with some fake Pikachu being taken away by their balloon. A couple of Officer Jennies spot the balloon and Growlithe takes it down. Jessie and James were going to use the distraction to allow them to steal all the spectators Pokémon with a vacuum. The Jennies notice their vacuum and ticket it. Team Rocket run for cover and disguise themselves as snack salesmen and start selling hot-dogs and ice-cream. Ash enters his last arena before he can battle in the Indigo arena. His opponent Jeanette starts with a Beedrill. Ash fights the Beedrill with his Bulbasaur. After a few close calls, Bulbasaur leech seeds it to victory. Next, Bulbasaur battles Scyther. Again it is close, but Bulbasaur wins again. Then, Jeanette brings out a Bellsprout. Ash believes it is going to be an easy win, but surprisingly to everyone Bellsprout defeats Bulbasaur. Ash sends Pikachu to take care of Bellsprout, but poor Pikachu is knocked out cold by Bellsprout's thin twig arm. Luckily before battle, Ash had gotten his Muk and this was his last hope for this match. Muk proves to be invulnerable to Bellsprout's attacks. Muk moves towards the helpless Bellsprout and smothers it. Ash has won his fourth match, and it is on to the central Indigo arena. After the match, Jessie and James found they had a successful day, and sold many hot-dogs and ice-cream. They are quite pleased with their ability to sell.",

The first one to carve a small ice sled out of ice is the winner. Ash uses Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Charizard. Although Misty and Tracey believe using Charizard was a mistake, but after a little pleading from Ash, Charizard carves out the ice block in three single fire blasts, making Ash the winner of the 2nd competition. The final was to use the ice sled to race down the mountain to the finish line. They began down the hill, and Ash got out of control. Danny pulled far ahead until he fell into a trap by Team Rocket. Ash stopped to check on him, and they used the opportunity to get Pikachu. Dan was able to stop them with his Electrode, which exploded in their balloon. They restarted the ice-sled race from the",

The Magikarp flips away, and within the net, drag the three of them into the water to wash downstream. They continue studying Magikarp as well as sitting down for a while to have a quick discussion about Pikachu and Ash's relationship and about Togepi, making it quite clear this guy knows about more than just Magikarp. Later, they are noticing the Magikarp are worried about something, and soon enough, TR's Magikarp sub starts swallowing all the Magikarp whole. It becomes too much for the sub to hold, and they start sinking, but after spitting a bunch out, float back up.

Then, James gets a Magikarp stuck on his head, to which they try to pull it off. Dr. Quackenpoker (or whatever) tries to stop them, because the Magikarp's grip is very strong and James is more likely to have his head pulled off.

Just then, something comes hurtling out of the sky towards them. A far away voice calls down an apology for almost hitting Ash with the object. Skyler, a boy training for a hot air balloon race, introduces himself to the gang and explains he was practicing for the upcoming event. Getting a marker as close to the center of the large, circular target by throwing it from the hot air balloon is one aspect of the competition. Intrigued by the hot-air balloon racing circuit, Ash quickly makes up his mind to enter as well. When Brock reminds him they don't have a chance of winning without a hot air balloon, Skyler's father says he has something to help them out. Pulling a balloon out of his shop, he begins to fill it up and to our heroes surprise, it's a Pikachu shaped hot air balloon! When Team Rocket decides to enter the race as well, Jesse and James sabotage several of the balloons the night before the big event.",

The father and daughter who had been outside during the catastrophe now look on helplessly as another daughter-trapped inside the house-is washed out toward a large whirlpool. Ash and Misty call their Pokémon to action and manage to save the young girl, but this proves to be only the first challenge of the day. As Ash and friends set about recollecting the Corsola that had reinforced the foundation of this family's home, Team Rocket soon arrives and attempts to steal not only the needed Corsola, but also collections of local artwork made from Corsola horns, which these Pokémon shed regularly. While assisting this local family, Misty waits not so patiently for an opportunity to catch the Corsola that had first driven the others away, and make it her own.",

The Pokémon had been depressed ever since it evolved from a Remoraid and was subsequently spurned by its onetime Remoraid friends. If the boy cannot somehow mend these friendships between Pokémon that have now grown different in appearance, he doesn't see any hopes of victory even in three years time.

With Ash already in strong position, Misty accidentally deploys Psyduck to face his Kingler. In a surprise turn, however, Psyduck launches a Confuse attack that wins the match for Misty. Ash takes his place in the stands and cheers for Misty as she begins her next round. Meanwhile Team Rocket watches in shock as-contrary to Jessie's plan-not only is the police presence at the event fortified, but the police show no sign of growing overconfident.",
