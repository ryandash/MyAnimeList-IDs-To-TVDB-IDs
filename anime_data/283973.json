  "SummaryEnglish": "Pokémon: The 'Bridged Series has been described as \"absurd\". This may be an understatement. Basically, we've taken the idea of \"Abridging\", copied it completely, and then did something slightly different. And applied it to Pokémon. It's a shorter, and hopefully funnier, version of Pokémon, produced by fans of the original in an attempt to make other fans laugh.",
