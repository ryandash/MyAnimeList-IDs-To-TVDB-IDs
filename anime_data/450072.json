    "SummaryEnglish": "After seeing Izumi Sano at a high jump competition, Mizuki Ashiya became completely enamored by him, even moving from the United States to Japan and enrolling in the same institute as him. However, Sano's academy is an all-boys school! Due to her bright personality, Mizuki quickly befriends her classmates without drawing suspicion to her gender. To her surprise, she ends up being not only Sano's classmate but also his roommate. Though she is now able to admire Sano in close proximity, she learns that Sano has quit high jumping and refuses to pick up the sport ever again for unknown reasons. Moreover, the academy's doctor, Hokuto Umeda, might be onto Mizuki's facade. Now, Mizuki has to find a way to reignite Sano's passion—all without revealing her secret.",
