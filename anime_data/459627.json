    "SummaryEnglish": "Inept at dealing with people, Higawa Koyuki maintains a wall between herself and others. She spends her time in highschool away from others, all alone. At least until she encounters Amamiya Minato who keeps closing the distance between them for some reason?! The aloof Koyuki, the popular Miki, the boundary-less Minato, and the easygoing and kind basketball team member, Youta. This is the story of these somewhat complicated four, and their tantalizing, bumbling youth!",
