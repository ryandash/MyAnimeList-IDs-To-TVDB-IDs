  "TitleEnglish": "Geobreeders",
  "SummaryEnglish": "Say hello to Kagura Total Security, a company composed of a half dozen misfits that specializes in trapping phantom cats. Don't laugh--they may look like cute little kitties, but due to the fact that they're data-phantoms, those furballs are liable to take over any computer controlled piece of hardware in sight. Add a serious attitude problem and near-invincible human form to that, and you've got a recipe for trouble. But, thanks to the lovely ladies and sole abused guy of KTS, there won't be any problems, right? Well, maybe... from their lethargic driver to their greedy boss to their trigger-happy, white-suited, \"mystery\" shrouded weapons expert, these people aren't exactly your first choice for getting the job done.",
