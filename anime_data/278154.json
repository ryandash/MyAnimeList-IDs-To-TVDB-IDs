One of the cadets, Shizuka Hoshijiro, accompanies Nagate while he is being questioned by the police, when a man called Ochiai appears and takes him to Captain Kobayashi, the highest authority of Sidonia, who claims that she intends to take him under her guard, with the condition of becoming one of Sidonia's Guardian pilots, to which he accepts. He is then registered as an official cadet and introduced to the others. In the occasion, Nagate learns that the Guardian pilots' main mission is to defend Sidonia against an alien hostile species known as the \"Gauna\", although the last time they encountered them was a hundred years before, and befriends Izana Shinatose, an hermaphrodite whose body can be adapted to procreate with either males or females, depending of the chosen partner. After failing to impress his peers at the pilot simulator, as the controls are different from those he trained to perfection at his former home, Nagate is called to his first sortie along Shizuka and Izana, but instead of piloting one of the recent Type 18 models, Nagate is entrusted with Tsugumori, a legendary Type 17 unit that belonged to a famous war hero, much to the anger of Norio Kunato, a cadet who always wanted to become its pilot and is being dispatched with him as well. Realizing that Tsugumori's controls are similar to those he is used to, Nagate's confidence is renewed but while performing a mining operation at a nearby asteroid with the others, a Gauna appears from inside it and attacks them.",

Kunato, Shizuka, En and Nagate plant their explosives around the tail of the Guana and prepare to detonate on Kunato's orders.

The Captain orders that all guardian frames be outfitted with the new experimental placenta piercing weaponry. 48 frames are deployed with this weaponry and a anti-planetary missile is also launched at the Gauna. Yuhata reveals the plan to the pilots stating that the 48 guardians will separate into 2 platoons. Platoon 2's objective is to destroy the tail of the Gauna (The propulsion site) and Platoon 1's objective is to destroy as much placenta as possible, so the anti-planetary missile can reach the planet at the heart of the Gauna. Nagate and Izana are both positioned in platoon 1 and when they arrive ahead of the Gauna they have exactly 2 hours before the anti-planetary missile reaches the Gauna. The plan initially goes smoothly with both platoons making short work of the Gauna's placenta. Suddenly the placenta beneath platoon 1 morphs into hyggs cannons, and begins destroying many Guardians. Platoon 2 nearly destroys the propulsion system, but Benisuzume quickly appears and destroys all 24 Guardians in platoon 2. With the entirety of platoon 2 gone and almost half the Guardians in platoon 1 destroyed, defeat seems inevitable. Yuhata quickly develops a new plan, to activate Sidonia's super hyggs particle cannon and fire it at the head of the Gauna.
