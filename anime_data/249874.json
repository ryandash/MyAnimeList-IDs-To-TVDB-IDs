    "SummaryEnglish": "Kurogane Taito is a freshman in Miyasaka High. After an injury in his leg(snapped tendon) that prevented him from practicing karate, which he excelled in since elementary school, he had always believed that he was an ordinary, regular guy. However, due to a forgotten promise exchanged with a beautiful Vampire (Most Ancient Sorcerer) Saitohimea nine years ago, he was in fact no longer ordinary. Nine years ago, he was injected with Saitohimea's poison, which prevented him from dying as long as he didn't die seven times within fifteen minutes. Shortly after his change, A boy named Kurenai Hinata attacked them with a demon and killed Taito six times. In order to prevent Taito from dying, Saitohimea agreed to leave with Hinata and have Taito's memory wiped. As a result, Saitohimea was experimented on and imprisoned within a world with no sound or light whatsoever, and Taito continued with his life as a normal human until his freshman year in high school.",

After biting him and giving him her poison, the girl confesses her love to him and encourages him to tell her he loves her as well, thus sealing the curse. Taito is then woken up as a high schooler by Shigure Haruka, whom we realize is a long time friend and a girl who has a crush on Taito. After a school day that includes bumping into the most popular boy in school, the cold hearted Kurenai Gekkou, Taito and Haruka split ways as Taito heads home. As he's crossing the street, he notices a sleeping truck driver headed straight for Andou Mirai, Gekkou's apparent subordinate, and jumps forward to push her out of the way only to be hit himself, an obvious killing blow... until Taito's head begins speaking to Mirai and his body stands by itself, grabbing the head and running off in a panic. As Taito frantically worries he suddenly remembers who the girl from his dream is, Saito Himea, the girl who enslaved him when he was younger and was taken away by a man who left Taito with no memories of Himea. When Taito speaks her name, she is released from her prison, turns into a sixteen year old and meets Taito at the playground from their youth.
