    "SummaryEnglish": "In the year 1935, the continent of Europa is engulfed by the flames of war. This great struggle which takes place between the Empire and the Federation, and which also spills over into neighbouring unaligned countries, will be recorded in history as the 2nd European War. However, there is one group of heroes who never made the front page. A group whose efforts were pivotal to Gallia's victory. That group is the regular army's Squad 422, codename: Nameless, and this is their story.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Low on supplies and on the run from the Gallian Regular Army, The 422nd squad, aka \"The Nameless\", meet a girl running from the town of Aslone, which was just captured by Imperial Troops, and their leader, Kurt Irving decide that they will retake it by themselves, knowing that the main force will not come to their aid. Elsewhere, Maximilian sends the Darcsen unit Calamity Raven to guard two experimental large artillery pieces at Dillsburg. After liberating Aslone, the Nameless leave the prisoners and their equipment on the villagers' custody and reclaim some supplies sent by their leader, Lt. Crowe. The following day, Squad 7 and Gallian regulars assault Dillsburg in early morning fog, but the artillery pieces rout the main Gallian force and while coming to help them, the Nameless rescue Isara, who was being pursued by Imperial soldiers."

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Upon being informed of the situation, the Nameless decide to take advantage of a narrow mountain pass to attack the Dillsburg base by surprise, but Gusurg of the Calamity Raven predicts their course of action and prepares an ambush. When a Gallian platoon recklessly attempts to charge forward, Riela Marcelis uses her Valkyrian powers to protect them, while destroying one of the artillery pieces. Thanks to a distraction planned by Kurt, Gusurg is ordered to retreat, just as he had the Nameless pinned down. After returning Isara safely to Squad 7, the Nameless then launch an attack on the second artillery piece, which is destroyed by a long range shot from the Edelweiss."
