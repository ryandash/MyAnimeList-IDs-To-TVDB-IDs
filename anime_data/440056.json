    "SummaryEnglish": "Reincarnated as a character in the legendary eroge title “Magical☆Explorer,” our hero ends up as an unlucky side-character instead of the game's lady-killer protagonist. Not to worry, though. Armed with his deep knowledge of the game (not to mention a few cheat codes), he'll do whatever it takes to win the hearts of the game's heroines and emerge as the most accomplished student at the Sorcerer's Academy.",
