During a worldwide conflict in 2010 known as the Second Pacific War, the once-proud country was reduced to rubble and mockingly renamed to Area 11. However, one student plans to free Japan from Britannia's control through an extraordinary rebellion. His name is Lelouch Lamperouge, and he is fuelled with hatred for the Empire, plotting to wipe its accursed name off the face of the planet. Lelouch's plans are unexpectedly accelerated upon meeting the mysterious woman C.C. who grants him an ability known as Geass that makes anyone Lelouch commands unable to defy his will. Now armed with a devastating power, Lelouch assumes the persona of Zero, a revolutionary figure who carries the hopes and dreams of the oppressed around the world. He vows to restore the glorious nation of Japan and deliver divine retribution to Britannia."

After being teased by Milly about Lelouch, Shirley mentions how he was acting strange after seeing the news, and Milly noticed it in Nunnally too. Kallen feels that Lelouch treats Nunnally with a different attitude than he treats her, which Milly attributes to Lelouch’s love for his little sister. The girls then get to talking about their bodies, and Kallen mentions that Nina looks different without her glasses. Milly says that she’s been trying to get Nina to wear contacts for a long time, which implies that they’ve known each other for a while. Indeed, as Nina explains, they are childhood friends, and her grandfather worked in Milly’s grandfather’s company developing Knightmare frames. Since she’s knowledgeable about this kind of thing, Kallen connects the Ashford name with the experimental Io and Ganymede types. When Milly reveals that the company went bankrupt because of the research costs, Nina feels that it was her grandfather’s fault. Milly, however, says that it was because of her own grandfather’s extravagance in throwing parties. In the end, he came over to Japan and survived by running this school thanks to personal connections. Milly then asks Kallen if she’s free the day after tomorrow, but Kallen remembers that she has an appointment at the Tokyo Tower. Since Kallen won’t be available, Milly decides to ask her now what her three sizes are so that she can have clothes made for parties and events.

For now, he has entrusted the parade route for Suzaku’s execution to her, and she’s made all the necessary preparations. Jeremiah doesn’t want to be humiliated any more because he’s now allowed two members of the royal family to be killed in front of him. Villetta doesn’t know what the first time he’s referring to is, so Jeremiah explains that he used to be a guard in the Aries palace as his first military duty eight years ago. The Aries palace was where Empress Marianne was, and on that one night, orders came from above to reduce the number of guards to a minimum. Because of that, the guards weren’t able to defend against the enemy intrusion, and this incident became Jeremiah’s first setback. He then took up a new post in Area 11 where Marianne’s orphans Lelouch and Nunnally had died, but now Clovis is dead too. When Jeremiah starts crying because of the memories of both Clovis and Marianne, Villetta asks him to wipe his tears because he’s not acting very lord-like. Realizing that she’s right, Jeremiah admits that his little sister Lilicia would laugh if she saw him like this, and as part of the distinguished Gottwald family, he vows to avenge Clovis and vindicate his honor. Unfortunately, Jeremiah’s dreams and aspirations go down in flames when, under the influence of Lelouch’s GEASS, he orders his forces to let the enemy escape."

Suzaku then recognizes Rivalz’s bike and recalls that he met someone with one when he was working in maintenance and washing cars before he joined the military. Rivalz figures out that it was a female and guesses that it was Suzaku’s sister or mother, but Suzaku explains that he doesn’t have a family and that this person he was indebted to has also… When Rivalz realizes that he hit on a bad subject, Suzaku tells him not to worry. Rivalz then asks about Suzaku’s home, so Suzaku reveals that he has none and is renting a room nearby courtesy of the military unit he works with. Hearing this, Rivalz suggests the school dormitory and offers his own room because he doesn’t have a roommate. Suzaku, however, cites his work and says that he chose to enter the army. Still, he thanks Rivalz. Inside the Lancelot’s hanger, Lloyd is hard at work while humming to himself when Cecile comes to tell him of some documents he has to get together.

Euphemia knows that this is the most acceptable out of the swimsuits that Clovis designed, and she hurries her sister to put it on. Guarding the outside of their dressing room are Darlton and Guilford, and Darlton comments on how his sons won’t be happy to hear about Cornelia’s swimsuit. Guilford realizes that Darlton is talking about the Glaston Knights who he had raised from orphans into knights, but he feels that Darlton is speaking a little imprudently. Darlton responds by calling Guilford stiff, which reminds Guilford to point out that Darlton hiding a gun in his swimsuit is unreasonable. With both men now staring in the direction of Darlton’s swimwear, Darlton decides that it does stand out and gives up on the idea. Suzaku and Cecile are meanwhile already outside, supposedly here on guard duty, though Cecile is simply relaxing by the water. She isn’t too worried because no one will expect Cornelia to be here as a surprise guest, and Lloyd didn’t even come since Knightmares weren’t needed. This causes Suzaku to comment on how it’s regrettable that they all couldn’t come together, but that’s not what Cecile had meant when she mentioned Lloyd. When Suzaku then compliments Cecile on her swimsuit, she gets embarrassed because she thinks that he’s teasing her about it. To Suzaku’s surprise, the entire student council group shows up, including Nunnally and Lelouch. Nunnally in particular is here because she wants to swim in the pool that Clovis designed - although she can’t move her feet, she feels that it means she’ll have all the more freedom in the water.

                    "SummaryEnglish": "The Ashford Academy student council is having a male and female reversal festival where all the girls have dressed up as guys and all the guys have dressed up as girls. Nunnally is having a lot of fun like this, but Kallen isn’t so sure that the guys are managing so well, and Milly goes to check on them. Although Suzaku, Rivalz, and Lelouch have all finished getting dressed, Lelouch doesn’t want the girls to see him yet because he needs to prepare his heart. Suzaku meanwhile isn’t embarrassed and after telling Lelouch that he’s really beautiful, Suzaku starts lifting his skirt up and down to give himself some air. Lelouch tells him to stop doing that because it’s vulgar, but Suzaku feels that it’s okay because he’s a guy. Milly and the other girls then barge into the room and are astonished by how good Lelouch looks in his dress. When Nunnally gets disappointed that she’s the only one unable to see a beautiful Lelouch, an awkward mood sets over everyone and Milly has to snap them out of it. Milly then remembers that for a true reversal festival, they have to change not only their appearances, but also how they are on the inside as well. Thus, she starts speaking in a deep voice as if she was a guy, and the others follow suit. Kallen comments on how Suzaku is used to doing this, so he explains that he had to do it as an entertainment act in the military. When Sayako then starts calling Lelouch “Luluko,” she has to explain to him that there are a lot of girl names in Japan that end with “ko.” Using this name, Milly claims that she’s liked Luluko for a long time, and Shirley says that she has too. After Shirley interprets Kallen’s snide remark about Luluko being popular as a sign that Kallen wants him too, Milly tells him that he’ll have to set things straight today about which of the three of them he likes. With all of this reverse gender craziness around him and with even Suzaku saying that three-timing isn’t good, Lelouch finally l"

After Lelouch recalls how that was the only fun time when everything else was sad, Nunnally notes that he hasn’t come over recently. Lelouch tells her that Suzaku has been busy with his military work, but it turns out that Nunnally was actually talking about C.C. Surprised, Lelouch tells his sister that C.C. isn’t his girlfriend, but he panics when trying to think of what to call her instead. He can’t say that she’s an accomplice, but he can’t call her a friend either because a girl who visits alone that late at night can’t be just a friend. Lelouch then thinks about calling her his teacher, but he can’t do that when C.C. had told Nunnally earlier that they were connected by a promise of the future. He finally considers calling her a boy who hasn’t matured to a deep voice yet since Nunnally hasn’t actually seen C.C.’s appearance. Luckily for Lelouch, Sayoko returns home and interrupts this conversation. Since Sayoko is employed by the Ashford family and just came from there, Nunnally asks about Milly’s marriage interview. Sayoko explains that, as always, Milly ruined it herself, and although Milly doesn’t show it, she’s surprisingly shy. The maid then gives Nunnally a package containing the second of the Thousand Origami Cranes Series. It seems that Nunnally had heard that there was another charm that granted wishes. Lelouch is shocked, however, to see that Sayoko has brought back a straw doll and several long metal nails."

As the announcer talks about opening a new page in history, Nunnally remembers a scene from her past when she and her brother had been sleeping over at Euphemia’s house. At the time, Lelouch had been chasing her around to get her to go to bed because he knew that otherwise she wouldn’t be able to get up in the morning. Nunnally, however, claimed that she wasn’t sleepy and that she wanted to play more since they finally got to stay over at Euphemia’s place. Euphemia herself didn’t mind, but Lelouch had made a promise to his mother, and he finally caught his sister. Nunnally then noticed a plate in Euphemia’s room that Lelouch recognized to be in commemoration of Marianne’s knighting, and Euphemia revealed that she got it from Cornelia. Since Nunnally had wanted one too, Lelouch had said that it was impossible and made it clear that this was Euphemia’s property. When he tried to take it back from her, Nunnally resisted and accused him of always being nice to only Euphemia, and during their struggle, they accidentally drop the plate. To Lelouch’s surprise though, Euphemia was actually glad that the plate had been broken into two pieces because now both she and Nunnally could have it. Nunnally had been so happy with this that she said she loved Euphemia and kissed her on the cheek, and the three of them had slept soundly that night together. In retrospect, Nunnally thinks about how that was a period of happiness and how that had been the last time she and her brother had been kids. It would only be a short while after this that she and Lelouch would realize that the world isn’t gentle. However, Nunnally thinks that Euphemia still believes and is trying to create a gentle world, and she feels that if it’s Euphemia, she’ll surely do"

He thinks back to a time when he had learned that Lelouch and Nunnally were officially dead in order to deceive Britannia. The year was 2010, and the two had been going to live with the Ashfords. Lelouch thought that Suzaku was going with his teacher Toudou, but it turns out that Suzaku couldn’t contact him, and he was instead going to Britannia headquarters. Before they had parted ways, Nunnally had asked him not to forget that there are always people who would extend a helping hand - that’s something she learned from her mother. The two had hoped to see each other again, but Suzaku had felt that a nuisance like him wouldn’t get to meet them again. He had known that their peaceful time as children was over, and he suspected that Lelouch knew that too. On that summer day, they had left something important in themselves and tried to mark the end, but Suzaku felt guilty because he had created that end by killing his father. He had wanted to talk with Lelouch about what he did, but the words didn’t come out, and he was relieved when Lelouch spoke first and vowed to destroy Britannia. Suzaku hadn’t been able to reply to that and had felt that Lelouch that was trying to kill his father, but he thought that this was probably the wrong answer. He believed that he and only he understood, however ever since that time, the time inside of him has stopped. He now thinks that if he had been able to talk with Lelouch back then, their futures might have been a bit different, and they could have looked for a little happiness. Things didn’t turn out that way, and, as he now finishes suiting up, Suzaku sees Lelouch as both his first enemy and man who became the worst friend."
