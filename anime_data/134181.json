An ordinary home commute later sets the stage for Tomo and Mafuyu to discover an infirm boy named Alexander »Sasha« Nikolaevich Hel who later intercedes for her when the Magnesium Qwaser Pax Romania igniting the paintings in an attempt to scare insight out of Mafuyu instigates a battle that serves as a tutorial for defining Qwasers and their soma-synthesizing Maria partners along with demonstrating the necessity of soma in driving their chemistry-based powers over their assigned element; if that is not confusing enough for Mafuyu, Sasha is ultimately far more austere than his playful-sounding nickname suggests as he sees no reason to adhere to Miyuri's student government nor the standard social protocols of civilization.",

Waylaid with no practical recourse, Sasha explains Mafuyu about the »Tsar's Crowning« icon along with the fanatical zeal driving the Adepts' pursuit thereof. Mafuyu's opprobrium of all Qwasers being murderers strikes a nerve within Sasha whose languishing into unconsciousness after holding her at bay sets the stage for a glimpse of Sasha's prologue in refining his iron-based Qwaser powers and gives way to a dexterously prepared apology pot of borscht from Mafuyu. Teresa admonishing caution of Mafuyu prior to departing with Sasha is the only warning of an innocuous bathtime session of girl talk becoming the preamble for Ayana showing her true colors as the Magnesium Qwaser as she wields Tomo in an obverse abduction; the ultimate irony of the whole confrontation is that even with her powers energized by Tomo's soma, Sasha successfully turns the tables on Ayana using an iconoclastic strategy in spite of his rage.",

While Mafuyu bristles in frustration at Sasha's anti-social conduct and how he turned the tables on her that morning, Miyuri is shocked to have her overture rejected and her persecution perverted to her detriment yet again; later that evening, Mafuyu prepares a room for Sasha only to find that housing Sasha as per Father Yuri's volition is far easier said than done when he twice ignores her ground rules and nearly spears her with a »No spying!!!« projectile toss. Meanwhile, the Copper Qwaser Ekaterina Kurae is nearly finished with her voyage to Japan when a trio of gunmen charges her the relinquishment of her gynoid guardian Anastasia; a very violent »Leave me alone!!!« counterstrike on the three men gives way to Miyuri fawning over Ekaterina after her arrival in Japan prior to initiating the shopping spree whose ultimate irony is that it is the forum for Ekaterina to prove her hypothesis of Hana making an excellent Maria partner for her.",

Even with Teresa recharging his soma, Ekaterina easily stalemates Sasha's close-range attacks and would have finished him off if not for Mafuyu and Teresa's combined interjection for temperance; while Mafuyu and Teresa perform the necessary housekeeping with the voyeurs and explaining about Athos, Ekaterina ultimately makes herself at home in Hana's apartment as she wastes no time in refining Hana as her Maria partner.",

Miyuri sees an opportunity to restore social homeostasis as she charges labor of Mafuyu along with Tomo and Sasha as guides for her family art exhibit. Ekaterina's teasing amplifies Sasha's aversion to being forced to work as a maid and sets the stage for Ekaterina to explain that her desire to see the Tsujidou Fabergé Egg is why the exhibit is; unfortunately, that same volition drives a paramilitary platoon to raid the exhibit and take the two Qwasers hostage along with the three girls. While Ekaterina relives her prologue of being raped by humans, Miyuri offers herself as erotic entertainment; Hana standing by with Anastasia and Miyuri having galvanized the libido of the soldiers combine into the perfect deus ex machina for Ekaterina to slaughter the soldiers using Miyuri's soma.

Miyuri and Fumika grappling with their issues obfuscates Hana being abducted as an open challenge to Ekaterina who soon finds that she is no match for Yuu on her own with Anastasia now a scattered pile of corroded copper.

Meanwhile, Sasha is shocked at how Father Yuri has kept him in the dark about Shin'ichiro's subterfuge; still, as Ekaterina points out, Shin'ichiro is far too dangerous because of the insidious powers he has that helped compose the prologue he has of having incinerated many people on behalf of the Adepts with a snap of his fingers. Fuming over being ordered neutrality when Tomo's life is in danger, Sasha reflects upon his prologue with Olja and having to dig by hand to bury her corpse before setting course toward Shin'ichiro's lair. Frightened for both Sasha and Tomo's safety, Mafuyu prosecutes a divergent concourse with Sasha before offering him her soma and an admonition for perpetual vigilance as she starts off ahead of him. Elizabeth and Sasha's duel ultimately becomes the ironic backdrop for manifesting the full scope of the occult and ethical imbroglio Yuudai Yamanobe has embroiled unto his daughter Tomo: Tomo is the remote proxy avatar of the Aurum (Gold) Qwaser.",

The expository concourse Friederich Tanner and Shin'ichiro prosecute about the true purpose of the heretic Qwasers Sasha has killed under Athos's orders sets the stage for Sasha to demonstrate great moral strength when he spares Teresa and Elizabeth prior to chasing after Shin'ichiro only to find himself knocked around like a rag doll as Shin'ichiro either dodges or otherwise perverts to his detriment each of his attempted attacks; it is only by channeling his protective desire for both Tomo and Mafuyu into forming the Fresh Blood Sword around Mafuyu's wooden sword that Sasha successfully turns the tables against Shin'ichiro using his full powers. Elizabeth is extremely anguished that Shin'ichiro is in a bad way but respects his dying wish for her to fight alongside Sasha as debris from the roof falls upon him; unfortunately for the hysterical Elizabeth, the Holy Aurum (Gold) Qwaser is still intent upon the »Tsar's Crowning« as she energizes the Imperial Egg to begin assimilating it. Although she is after the Egg for her own reasons, Ekaterina's ranged energy attacks ultimately become the ironic deus ex machina to foil the Holy Aurum (Gold) Qwaser's plans along with emancipating both Mafuyu and Tomo; unfortunately, Friederich is not hostile to taking Tomo as a consolation prize.",

Meanwhile at Saint Mihailov's Academy, the anxiety over Tomo's uncertain status is the elephant in the room as Mafuyu grapples with the reality that the Aurum Qwaser will still wield Tomo as his avatar even if a rescue attempt were to succeed. Hana playfully deriding her affection for Sasha does nothing to prepare her for Taisuku and Mutsumi enrolling in the school as transfer students the next morning -- apparently to prosecute some kind of operation for the »Tsar's Crowning«. After waylaying her between classes, Sasha inquires Mutsumi her presence at the Academy only to have his challenge and Mafuyu's »What the hell are you doing!?!« intercession perverted to both his detriment and Mafuyu's before Taisuku contributes to the encounter. The student council president Yumie Hiragi delivering a stern »Keep it in the barn!!!« admonition to the pair prior to becoming the quarry of the Ouroboros Elemental Circuit ultimately becomes the deus ex machina for the illuminating Taisuku and Mutsumi's true objective -- the location and acquisition of the Sword of Maria incantation needed for activating the »Tsar's Crowning« -- the very thing Mafuyu ironically wields against Mutsumi's seductive coercion.",

While Ekaterina plays the consummate actress to defuse a teacher's challenge for loitering, Joshua is shocked to find that there is no honor among his teammates when it comes to Tomo's soma; whatever the Adepts' volition for her, it becomes apparent that Tomo is more valuable in one piece -- much to Mafuyu's relief when Tomo sends a »Keep the faith and the home fires burning« video after her day with Astarte who is already a High Maria. Still, even with Tomo having the run of the Adepts' hideout complete with the security detail, the Holy Aurum Qwaser ultimately sees no reason to abandon her plans and Georg Tanner clearly has plans for Mafuyu through that elemental circuit.",

Be it Tomo's absence or the experiences of being used as a diary cow, Miyuri has somehow detected a deviant diagnostic with Mafuyu who she encourages to attend Ekaterina's birthday party with Sasha who is shocked to learn that the infirmary nurse Urada Oikawa has extensive data about the war Athos is prosecuting with the Adepts at St. Mihailov's Academy along with a prologue of assisting Yuudai with his research on the »Tsar's Crowning« alongside Shin'ichiro before handing Sasha the key to Yuudai's research. While Sasha ultimately finds it no trouble at all to defeat Elizabeth in the crazed artificial beast incarnation, Friedrich still accomplishes his objective of delivering the distraught Ekaterina an urgent exhortation to catalyze the advent of the »Tsar's Crowning« icon; considering the destruction of Anastasia and Hana's friendship overtures being subsequently repulsed that evening along with her abrupt departure, it is not out of the question to say Ekaterina is giving it some thought.",

The Hydrogen Qwaser Milk drawing a lot of attention due to her gas mask as she leads Jita Phrygianos through buying a cake in a store becomes the backdrop for Mutsumi and Tasuku to pick a fight with the two Qwasers while Friedrich abducts Mafuyu in order to avail the Sword of Maria elemental circuit within her body. Even with Hana's syllabus of Ekaterina being abruptly missing in action, Sasha is shocked to find the irony that Ekaterina is ultimately the most dangerous adversary on the scene as she threatens Mafuyu's life prior to the advent of the Aquatic Sanctuary; as if to rub salt in the wound, Ekaterina arrogantly decides to refuel herself with Mafuyu's soma caring nothing that the most power she will have in the Holy Roman Empire version 2.0 is as Friedrich's second-in-command.",
