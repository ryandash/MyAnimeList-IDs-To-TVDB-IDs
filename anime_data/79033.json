    "SummaryJapanese": "時は未来、すぐれた生物学者ロジャー・ニュートンは時の科学の力をもってしても未だ解明されない人工の生命創造の課題に密かに挑戦し、その完成は間近だった。それを知った陰謀家コルボは、その秘密を盗もうと企んでいた。 ニュートンはその難を避けるため、妻のエレーヌ、それに永年の共同研究者である＜生きている脳＞サイモン、ライトとともに月にある隠れ家に逃れた。 間もなくニュートン夫妻の間に男の子が生まれ、カーティスと名付けられた。さらに最初の人工人間である＜鋼鉄製ロボット＞の創造に成功し、ひきついで第二の人工生命＜合成アンドロイド＞を創り出したが、その時コルボが現れ、妻のエレーヌと共に暗殺されてしまった。残されたカーティスはサイモンとグラッグ、オットーの三人によって月世界で育てられた。比類なき科学者＜生きている脳＞サイモンはカーティス少年の知育の面を担当した。そして、科学者のあらゆる分野の知識を授け、すべての工学的知識と技術を短時間のうちに身につけさせた。＜ロボット＞グラッグは、その桁外れの力とスタミナの一端を独特の方法で少年に注ぎ込んだ。＜アンドロイド＞オットーは持ち前の精神と肉体の両面にわたる驚くべき敏捷な反応の能力を植え付けた。カーティス・ニュートンが見事な一人前の男に成人したある日、サイモンは彼の両親の死の真相を話して聞かせた。そして今後、科学を不正な目的に利用しようとする悪の手と勇敢に戦ってほしいと懇望した。かくしてカーティスは自らキャプテンフューチャーと名乗り、宇宙と正義の平和のために戦うのだった。",
