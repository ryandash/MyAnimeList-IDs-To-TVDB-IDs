          "SummaryEnglish": "College student Violet visits McDonald's for the first time for a bite. Surrounded by a bunch of people, she gets better at work day by day, and grows. Main character Violet's voice is provided by AKB48 Team 8's Okabe Lin. General manager Hoshino-senpai is voiced by AKB48's Yui Yokoyama. Studio Colorido is the animation studio; they paid a lot of attention to actual stores to portray the appearance of a bustling McDonald's. McDonald's is looking to fill part-time jobs. Just like Violet, why don't you become a member of the crew? Surely there is a job that is perfect for you.\"",
