  "TitleEnglish": "A-ko the Vs",
  "SummaryEnglish": "This two-part story takes place in an alternate universe, where counterparts of our heroines find themselves in the middle of a space opera. In this world, A-ko and B-ko are bounty-hunter partners who hunt giant tortoises on a sand planet. When C-ko is kidnapped by a gang of space pirates, A-ko and B-ko set off to rescue her—thinking only of the reward money offered by her wealthy father. Aided by a pint-sized Galactic Police Officer named Maruten, the girls discover that C-ko's abduction is part of a much larger scheme. Gail, the charismatic leader of the space pirates, intends to use C-ko's body as a host for the spirit of Xena, a long-dead sorceress. Although Gail believes that Xena will \"purify\" the universe, he is oblivious to her true motive—to annihilate all universes and create a new one in which she is the absolute ruler.",
