    "TitleEnglish": "The One Within the Villainess",
    "SummaryEnglish": "Although Emi Kobayashi is heartbroken over her own death, she realizes she has reincarnated as her favorite character from an otome game—the villainess Remilia Rosa Graupner. Emi is kind and generous by nature and therefore determined to give Remilia the life she deserves. Her warmth soon charms every key character, and she ensures Remilia's bright future. For a decade, Remilia has watched over Emi from the inside, satisfied as long as the tender-hearted Emi was happy herself. The arrival of the protagonist, Pina Blanche, envelops Emi's world in darkness. From the beginning, Pina shows her true colors, resorting to underhanded methods to destroy Remilia's reputation until everyone turns against her. When despair overwhelms Emi, control over her body returns to Remilia. But Remilia is not so forgiving that she will simply let Pina have her way. She swears to take revenge and show everyone who wronged Emi the power of a true villainess.",
