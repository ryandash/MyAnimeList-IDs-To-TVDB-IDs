The three Seki team up to try to fight it, but are unable to do any real damage. Aki manages to get a hit in, but it's not deep enough and Kuramitsuha takes a beating. However, Kyohei is able to get a clean hit in while it's charging its laser. Aki realizes that the Kakashi can consume minds, which is why it could move without a Seki.

Utao just wakes up on Hibino’s lap as Hibino’s dad arrives concerned about his daughter’s safety. Meanwhile, Koushirou and Moyako keep their distance from them talking about how Mahiru and Kirio have disappeared. The scene cuts to Kirio sitting alone in a park thinking about why this all happens, somewhere else Mahiru is asking herself why Kyohei isn’t a Seki anymore with that power. And that’s when Kyohei starts to remember back when he was a teenager and how he failed to do anything about Sensei. He always felt like an outsider who wasn’t part of what happened despite his efforts to do the opposite and therefore he distanced himself from the village not feeling like he belonged there. Then his flashback turns into a nightmare and Kyohei ends up waking up and hugging Hibino by reflex who was standing near his bed at that moment by chance. Later on the rooftop of the hospital Kyohei apologizes to Hibino for hugging her all of a sudden but Hibino kisses him and admits that she actually liked Kyohei’s words.
