    "SummaryEnglish": "Corporate slave Arihito Atobe's death in a freak bus accident marks the beginning of his new life as a kind of adventurer called a Seeker. Reborn into a fantasy world, he settles into a previously unknown job class called “rearguard,” capable of providing his (all-female) party with critical attack, defense, and recovery support. And it comes with an added bonus: Simply being at the back of the party line increases his companions' fondness for him! Freed from the shackles of corporate life, Arihito is eager to start fresh as a newly minted Seeker!",
