  "SummaryEnglish": "Fashionable and upbeat high schooler Aya falls head over heels for an employee at a local CD shop. He's got an air of mystery about him, great style, and an impeccable music taste. Little does she know—this supposedly male employee is actually her female classmate Mitsuki!

Revealing the truth is out of the question for Mitsuki—but perhaps getting closer to Aya wouldn't be so bad…",
