  "TitleEnglish": "Wonder Beat Scramble",
  "SummaryEnglish": "Wonder Beat Scramble is a Japanese science fiction anime series planned and supervised by Osamu Tezuka in his later years, which ran from April 16 to November 19, 1986, on TBS. Produced by Mushi Production, Tokyo Broadcasting System and Tokyu Agency, it was directed by Satoshi Dezaki and Seiji Arihara, with Arihara, Tsuneo Tominaga and Sunao Katabuchi serving as chief unit directors, Setsuko Shibuichi designing the characters, Yūichi Higuchi designing the mechanical elements and Ryō Yonemitsu and Hajime Mizoguchi composing the music. This is the first TV anime work of the newly established Mushi Production after its bankruptcy, and is an original project by Satoshi Itō based on the \"Bacteria Rangers\" of the 1963 Astro Boy TV series. The story was overseen by scholars in the fields of medicine and physiology, and at the end of each episode, Tezuka, himself being a Doctor of Medicine, appeared in live-action segments to explain the organs of the human body and physiological functions.",

      "SummaryEnglish": "In the year 2119, the space life exploration ship Greensleeves encountered the wandering planet X23, and after discovering traces of the extinction of advanced civilization on other planets that X23 had passed through, the World Federation ordered Greensleeves to destroy X23, but its captain, Isao Sugita, refused and cut off all communication. Two years later, Isao's eldest son, Susumu, who lives in Nagisa City, is suddenly taken to the Phoenix Tower of the Institute for Comprehensive Health Science, where Dr. Miya asks him to join the White Pegasus, a special medical unit. In Nagisa City, a number of residents are collapsing due to unexplained health problems, and they are to be treated by injecting the special intra-vehicle entry vessel \"Wonder Beat\" into the affected areas by micronizing it. Thus begins the battle between Susumu and the rest of the White Pegasus team and the unidentified aliens who repeatedly attack the human body.",
