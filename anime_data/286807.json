  "TitleEnglish": "Wonder Beat Scramble",
  "SummaryEnglish": "Wonder Beat Scramble is a Japanese science fiction anime series planned and supervised by Osamu Tezuka in his later years, which ran from April 16 to November 19, 1986, on TBS. Produced by Mushi Production, Tokyo Broadcasting System and Tokyu Agency, it was directed by Satoshi Dezaki and Seiji Arihara, with Arihara, Tsuneo Tominaga and Sunao Katabuchi serving as chief unit directors, Setsuko Shibuichi designing the characters, Yūichi Higuchi designing the mechanical elements and Ryō Yonemitsu and Hajime Mizoguchi composing the music. This is the first TV anime work of the newly established Mushi Production after its bankruptcy, and is an original project by Satoshi Itō based on the \"Bacteria Rangers\" of the 1963 Astro Boy TV series. The story was overseen by scholars in the fields of medicine and physiology, and at the end of each episode, Tezuka, himself being a Doctor of Medicine, appeared in live-action segments to explain the organs of the human body and physiological functions.",
