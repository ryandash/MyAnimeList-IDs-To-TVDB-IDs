  "SummaryEnglish": "The five best friends and graduates of Seika Girls High School - Mami, Mika, Reiko, Shizuka, and Kiyomi - have managed to secure careers for themselves in the world. With their future on course, they can now concentrate on marriage, the art of finding a husband and other half to spend their lives with. However, amidst all the dating services and matchmaking, the shy and withdrawn Shizuka doesn't seem to have any prospects, and the cool and aloof Kiyomi has no interest whatsoever in men. As time passes by and youth slips away, the girls carry out whatever it takes to get a man for themselves and each other. Can Shizuka and Kiyomi manage to find someone?",
