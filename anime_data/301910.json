He soon learns that the child would have lived anyway, and that the Spirit World was not expecting him to die. For this reason, he is then offered the chance to be revived by the mysterious Botan, Guardian of the river Styx. At first, Yusuke initially refuses the proposal, but ultimately accepts after seeing the people he thought did not care for him, including his childhood friend Keiko Yukimura, his mother Atsuko, and his rival Kazuma Kuwabara grieving for him at his wake. Yusuke meets Koenma, son of the ruler of the Spirit World, and is given the task of raising a spirit egg that, when hatched, may return him to his body. Yusuke appears to Keiko in a dream to tell her that he will soon be revived. He later possesses the body of Kuwabara for one hour to find Keiko to inform Atsuko not to have his body",

Yusuke later helps him study by communicating to him in his dreams. Kuwabara becomes furious after the teacher attempts to alter his passing grade, yet Yusuke is able to prevent his violence.

After a confrontation with Squee's teddy bear, Shmee, Johnny leaves, informing Squee that they are neighbors. Later, a survey-taker tries to collect Johnny's opinion on a recent rash of murders around the city. When the man asks about a possible case of vampirism, Johnny explains that he has to keep a wall in his house wet with the blood of his victims or else a monster imprisoned there will break free, then pushes the surveyor forcefully through a boarded window, scaring Squee in the process. Johnny goes on a rampage with a spork in a \"Taco Hell\" restaurant, incited by an elderly patron referring to him as 'wacky'. Following the slaughter, Johnny watches its coverage on the news. Johnny debates Psychodoughboy and Nail Bunny on whether or not he should commit suicide, but the group gets distracted by a commercial for diarrhea medicine.",

Vargas explains that, because of his faith, he is not afraid of death, and Johnny kills him, but lacks his usual sense of satisfaction. Johnny captures a beautiful woman and tells her that he will spare her because he is better than her, but then kills her with a scythe anyway when he realizes that they are both just as ugly on the inside. Johnny goes on a date with Devi, a cashier at a local bookstore; torn between his infatuation and his need to satiate his deeper psychotic urges, he attempts to stab her, but Devi escapes after nearly killing Johnny. Later in the issue, Johnny makes a late-night run to a \"24/7\" convenience store for a \"Cherry Brain Freezy\" and after the store clerk tells him he can't because they shut off at 2:00 a.m (in the story, this particular part takes place at 2:15 a.m, as it says in a little caption) he then proceeded to kill the man, and is unable to kill himself after using the one bullet in the gun.",

The sequence ends with Johnny warning the remaining patrons to 'think quickly, for a long life is never a guarantee' seconds before Café le Prick is destroyed by an explosion. A man tries to molest Squee after the boy becomes separated from his neglectful mother in the mall, but Johnny intervenes and kills the pedophile while explaining people's baser natures to the horrified Squee. Johnny tortures a drunken bully named Krik with an electric drill. Johnny abducts a goth couple, Dillon and Tess, after Dillon ruins a screening of Kafka for him. Johnny realizes that he cannot die or be brought to justice for his murders, and that the doughboys are no longer under his control.

A woman named Damned Elise gives Johnny a tour of heaven. Johnny starts a massive psychic battle when he discovers that the souls in Heaven have mental powers which includes the ability to explode people's heads. In Hell, Johnny meets Señor Diablo, who reveals that Johnny is a \"flusher\" or \"waste lock\", a creature chosen to concentrate the spiritual byproducts generated by humans into a specific object or point in space, in this case the wall in Johnny's house. As Johnny died, the wall unleashed the built-up negative energy, in the process destroying the universe, which was then restored. Johnny then finds out that Hell's torments are entirely self-inflicted by the trivialities with which people obsessed over in life--everything from commuting to cream cheese to lint. Johnny is resurrected and finds himself in his house, but with all of his voices gone, replaced by a talking \"Bub's Burger boy\" named Reverend Meat.[16] Johnny is left unsure if he really died or if he experienced some kind of dream or hallucination. Later, Johnny stands in line at a 24/7 to buy a \"Frooty Pop\" when a robber bursts in and shoots the clerk.",

A copycat killer named Jimmy pays Johnny a visit and confesses to several murders, including one rape incident mentioned earlier to Johnny by both a surveyor and Tess, which enrages Johnny so much that he eviscerates Jimmy with hooks and crushes his face with a sledgehammer. Afterwards, Johnny tries to phone Devi with a prerecorded message, but she delivers a diatribe against him. Johnny then argues with Reverend Meat, who urges him to give in to his emotions, though the disembodied voice of Nailbunny tells Johnny to resist. Johnny kills a beggar requesting money for beer by shooting an arrow into his back with a \"kick me\" sign attached. Johnny then pays one last visit to his friend Squee, before his departure, and tells the boy that he will soon leave for a vacation, then smashes the back of Squee's father's head with a toy robot. Johnny then (for once) cuts the crap, and tells the boy that he just wants to make sure that he watches out for himself, stating that he his father is just one of his worries. Johnny then gives his young little friend some surprising words of wisdom, telling him that it's easy to be affected by his own fears and hatred, but he does not want them warp his mind and damage him permanently, and just hope that he manages as he grows up. The series ends with Johnny sitting on a cliff overlooking the city, writing in his diary.",

Though he initially wishes to defeat NegaScott in order to forget his relationship with Ramona, he instead merges with NegaScott, thus remembering and accepting responsibility for his poor actions in his previous relationships. Scott returns to Toronto to fight Gideon at his newly-opened club, where Envy is making her solo debut. Gideon invites Scott to join the League Of Evil Exes; when Scott refuses, Gideon kills him with the Power of Love sword. Scott awakens in a desert, where he encounters Ramona. They reconcile and Scott uses his extra life to return to the club, where he confronts Gideon inside Ramona's subspace and encourages Ramona to overcome Gideon's influence. When Scott witnesses Gideon berate Envy, he realizes he has been no better than Gideon in his past relationships, causing him to gain the Power of Understanding. Scott and Ramona unite, defeat Gideon together, and decide to give their relationship another chance. In an epilogue, Scott works as a co-chef with Stephen, who reveals he is gay and dating Joseph. Scott and Kim start a new band, and Knives leaves to attend university. Scott and Ramona affirm their desire to face the challenges of a relationship together, and walk hand-in-hand into a subspace door.",
